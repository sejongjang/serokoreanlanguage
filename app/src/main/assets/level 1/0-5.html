                <p>Okay this is is the last page of the introduction. See the pretty flower at the bottom? That flower
                    is on the last page of every chapter. Usually it is accompianied by some "lauch quiz" buttons, but
                    since this is just the introduction we'll go easy on you.</p>
                <p>Just a couple quick notes before we get started:</p>
                    <p><b>1.</b> Forget
                    everything you know about languages. Okay, not literally, but
                    don't try and think about Korean in terms of English. You can't just substitute word for word as
                    Korean has no common root language with English. Starting with a clean slate with be easier, seriously.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b> If you didn’t really care for your grade school English grammar classes don’t worry. We won't get
                    into
                    anything too heady here. Rather this program is meant to give you a sense
                    that someone is right by your side teaching you in a personal and understandable way. We’ll even
                    keep things
                    light-hearted with experiences from Korea, jokes, and fun example sentences. You’ve got nothing
                    to
                    sweat!</p>
                    <p>Ready to get started? Let’s go! (Just swipe over to the next chapter.)</p>
