                <p>So the truth is that there’s much more to the Korean Wave than just some manufactured Barbies and
                    Kens.
                    It’s a push to return to the values that make us human. It’s a movement that, despite a purpose of
                    providing entertainment and earning profit, is also very uplifting.</p>
                <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this little look into one of the most visible modern facets of Korea. We’ll be
                    going back and forth between talking about ancient and modern Korea, and naturally we’ll also be
                    talking about North Korea in the coming culture chapters. For now though, back to the language! (No quiz this chapter).</p>
