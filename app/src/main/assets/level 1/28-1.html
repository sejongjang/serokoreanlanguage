            <p>Now we’re not going to tackle all seven levels in one chapter here. We will learn the basics of the most
                useful form, however. Ready to get started? Actually, you already have.


            </p>

            <p>
                You may have noticed that so far all the sentences we’ve introduced to you have ended in 요. As we
                discussed, the verb always comes last in Korean sentences. One of the main features of Korean
                formalities is verb conjugation. In English our verbs change or conjugate to reflect when something
                takes place (past, present, future, or progressive) and to match the subject (“She is”, “I am”). Our
                verbs can also reflect things like suggestions (“Shall we go?”, “Let’s go”), and commands (“Go!”). You
                can even make verbs into nouns by adding “ing” like in “running” or “eating”. In English, however, you
                don’t actually have to do a whole lot of conjugating thanks to the helping verbs that go with our normal
                verbs.


            </p>
            <p>Korean verbs meanwhile can do all this, and quite a bit moreFragment without any helping verbs. However, you can
                breathe a sigh of relief because you’ll recall that Korean doesn’t have subject-verb agreement. You just
                don’t have to worry about changing your verb depending on what kind of subject you’ve got (or at least
                not in the English way). More good news is that Korean verb conjugation is relatively consistent and
                easy to learn, despite being able to accomplish so much.

            </p>
            <p>Back to 요-here is the Goldilocks porridge comparison. Remember the story? Goldilocks sneaks into the house
                of the three bears. When she gets there she’s hungry, and she can see three bowls of porridge on the
                table. The first bowl Goldilocks tries is too hot, so she moves on and tries another bowl. The second
                one is too cold so she moves on again, and finally finds a bowl that’s just the right temperature. We
                can divide modern spoken Korean into three categories that are comparable to Goldilocks’ bowls of
                porridge. People who learn the wrong speech level first could have difficulties. We’ll save you from
                burning your tongue or tasting nasty cold porridge, by teaching you the 요-form first. Here’s a look at
                the three forms.
