            </div>
            <p>Since 1953, the two countries have changed a lot. Culture, values, politics, even language have become
                foreign when you compare the two side by side. This is one of the reasons many see effective unification
                as an impossibility. Cultural norms such as dining customs, greetings, and appropriate obedience to
                authority have diverged. Politically, the South is much more libertarian and values individual freedom
                over allegiance to government while the North values absolute obedience to authority, while both have a
                great sense of national pride and patriotic spirit.
            </p>
            <p>The Korean language in the South has been modified and tweak to make it sound smoother and easier to use.
                For example, 두음 법칙 or sound change rules are what govern pronouncing 합리 as 함니 and spelling 녀자 as 여자.
                Yes, you read that correctly. The word for girl(여자) in North Korea is 녀자 and 낚시(fishing) in the North is
                락시. The south noticed that the ㄹ sound is more rough at the beginning of a word so they changed most to
                either an ㅇ or ㄴ to make words flow better. There are other grammatical rules that are different and the
                fact that the North doesnt have many loan words like 스트레스(stress) or 커피(coffee) make trying to have a
                conversation between a South and North Korean pretty hard. North Korea wants to maintain Korean’s
                “original” beauty and so they shun a lot of changes to the language. There are a lot more about 두음법칙 and
                North Korean language differences that we will cover later. The point is, the two countries have changed
                a lot over the years.
