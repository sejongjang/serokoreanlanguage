                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>The seasons are a joy to experience in Korea. The country has a true, four-season weather pattern
                    with each season representing a long and distinct period. Summers are hot and winters are cold.
                    And I mean hotter than you’d expect…</i></p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n this section we are going to be talking about not only what kind of weather to expect in Korea but
                    also the vocabulary and phrases you’ll need to know to be able to describe almost any type of
                    weather you encounter. Knowing how to read weather forecasts and describe weather conditions is an
                    essential skill to have in any language, especially in Korean. Here we are going to go over the 4
                    seasons that you will experience in Korea and their special characteristics. Then, after we can get
                    into the nitty gritty of describing weather using the language itself.

                </p>
                <p>봄 Spring: Spring is the shortest but most beautiful time of the year on the korean peninsula. The
                    weather is absolutely perfect with temperatures ranging from 65°~75°F (18°~24°C) and short spurts of
                    rainfalls to make the air crisp and fresh. Spring is also the time when Korea’s famous Cherry
                    Blossom Festivals (벚꽃 축제) are happening country wide, normally happening around late March and early
                    to mid April. The seafood in the spring that can be found in southern coastal cities such as Busan,
                    Ulsan, Geoje, Gwangyang, Mokpo, and Jeju are top grade. This coupled with the most awe inspiring
                    views during hikes of waterfalls, wildlife, surrounding mountain ranges, the ocean, and cities below
                    gives people a real reason to exercise. The sheer beauty of Korea during spring is the main reason
                    most people visit during April and May and also because of it’s good weather, amazing food,
                    festivals, and cheap flights.

                </p>
                <p>여름 Summer: Summer is two faced beast that can either give you the time of your life, or make you
                    sweat off all the calories you just ate for lunch. We will start with the positives. Korea in the
                    summer has more exciting events, concerts, parties, excursions, etc. available than any other time
                    of the year. Events like the Boryeong Mud Festival where people from all over the world come to
                    enjoy a weekend of becoming kids again to play in the mud, have good food, attend amazing concerts
                    and repeat. Other events offered during the summer include professional Korean baseball games, theme
                    parks such as Everland or Lotte World, and going to famous beaches in the south such as Haeundae
                    (해운대) in Busan or anywhere on Jeju Island (제주도). On the other hand, early in July the rainy season
                    (장마) comes around for a few weeks and leaves the air extra humid for when the summer heat hits. This
                    can create some problems for some people’s hair so prepare appropriately. But overall, Korea’s
                    summers can feel like a paradise if you stay at some of the world class oceanside resorts located
                    around the country in Gangneung (강릉), Busan, and Jeju.
