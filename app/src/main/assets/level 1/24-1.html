            <p>In English conjunctions and transitions usually take the form of separate conjunctive words that you
                insert
                in the sentence, but as we’ve talked about, in verb-centric Korean, conjunctions are usually a
                conjugation
                of the verb or adjective. The first form we’ll learn follows this pattern, and is the Glue+서 form.
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">
                밥 먹어서 배 안고파요<br>
                저는 잘 몰라서 대답하지 못해요<br>
                아들이 없어서 엄마가 슬펐어요.

            </div>
            <p>You can think of this word as being similar to the English word “since”. It does portray a direct
                relationship between reason and result, but there may also be other reasons involved as well.
            </p>

            <p>Conjugation is simple because it’s just the process of Glue with 서 stuck onto the end. The “서” ending
                cannot be connected with tense markers(었/겠). This means essentially that it is tense-neutral and that
                it’s tense is determined by other parts of the sentence.

            </p>
            <p>Finally I’ll warn you that the Glue+서 form usually comes in the middle of the sentence, as in the above
                examples. The exception is when you are responding to an inquiry asking for a reason for something.
            </p>
            <p>Also, it can sometimes be difficult to hear the difference between the past tense and the Glue+서 form.

                재영씨는 왜 안왔어요?<br>
                제가 바빴어요.<br>
                재영씨는 왜 안왔어요?<br>
                제가 바빠서요.
            </div>
            <p> Listen to how there is sort of a break in the word 바빴어요. This break, along with the more dominant “S”
                sound are clues that it’s the past-tense.
