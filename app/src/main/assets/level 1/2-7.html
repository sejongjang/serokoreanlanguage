            <p>에 is a vowel which, in the original version of 한글 (in the times of King Sejong), had a sound distinct
                and different from
                애. Over time, however, they’ve become very similar. Some might even say indistinguishable. All
                languages undergo
                this drifting process in which sounds, letters, words, and accents—everything—is subject to change over
                time. This modern 에 sound is the pure “eh” you’re familiar with in words like "met", “empty”, and “elevator”.
                The fundamental difference between 애 and 에 is highlighted perfectly by the debate raging in the English
                speaking world over how to pronounce the word “egg”. You have the group that insists it ought to be
                pronounced
                with more of an “A” sound, and the group that argues that egg is spelled with an E and should thus be
                pronounced with a pure “eh” sound.</p>
            <p>In truth there's very little difference between the two and you likely wouldn't even notice whether
                your friend says Ae-gg or Eh-gg when they're talking fast. In Korea they've already gotten over the
                fact that this difference is not important. As a result of this, it doesn't really matter what you say
                when you see 애 or 에. If you are a pronunciation purist however, 애 correlates with the A sound (like
                “Ae-gg”) and 에 is more the pure "E" sound (like “Ehh-gg”).</p>
            <p>The one compound-vowel for 에 is 웨.</p>

            <p>Now we have yet another vowel sound that sounds the same as "외" and "왜". *Sigh*. There's really no way
                to tell them apart just from listening. Practice with reading and writing will help you know when to
                use each vowel.</p>

            <p>나에(to me) and 나의(my) are another pair that sound the same but are spelled differently, otherwise known as a homophone. Don't worry too much about
                these though, as you'll figure it out in no time.</p>
