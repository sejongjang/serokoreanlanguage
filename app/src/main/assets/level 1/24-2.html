            <p>The next form is the (으)니까 form. We can think of this as similar to the English word “so”. (으)니까 form has
                a feeling of leading to a conclusion or connecting things just like the word “so” does in English. We
                can use (으)니까 by framing it in between, first, our causal statement (the reason something can or cannot
                happen) and then followed by the result. Now how do we conjugate our verbs to fit this form?

                    3. Add 니까 if no 받침 is present, add 으니까 if 받침 is present<br>
                    수영하--->수영하니까<br>
                    만드--->만드니까 <br>(because the final syllable was 드, already having the same vowel as 으, despite not
                    currently having a 받침, replaces the 으 in 으니까)<br>
                    먹--->먹으니까

            <p>Here is an example of how to place this in a sentence. if we want to say “I am healthy because I
                exercise” then we would switch up the order to be more like “I exercise + (으)니까 + I am healthy” leading
                to the full korean, “운동하니까 건강해요". We can use (으)니까 in almost any situation that has a cause and a
                result.


            </p>
            <p><i>*You may see (으)니까 shortened to (으)니 at times. In this case 운동하니까 would be shortened to 운동하니.
                </i></p>
