            <p>“To be or not to be.” These are the famous words uttered by the character Hamlet in the play of the same
                name written by the one and only William Shakespeare. In this case Hamlet is contemplating the value of
                his very existence. Should he be—should he continue to exist? Or should he just end it all—should he
                not exist?</p>
            <p>In English we use the verb “to be” to describe existence and to equate things with each other. We
                learned in Chapter 5 how to use the Korean copula 이다. Now we’ll be learning about the verb to exist—있다,
                and the verb to not exist—없다. The good news is that you don’t have to be a lingual genius like
                Shakespeare to learn how to use these words because they are actually much simpler than English.</p>
            <p>In order to learn how to use 있다 and 없다 however, we'll first need to learn how to designate the subject
                of the sentence. In English this happens automatically. In the sentence “Dogs chase cats” what might
                the subject be? Ten points for you because you got it right—the subject is of course “dogs”. But how do
                we know this? You see, subjects, objects, verbs—basically all grammatical roles are baked into the
                syntax of the English language. This means that English has inflexible word order. The words absolutely
                must come in a specific order to achieve a specific meaning. If not, then the meaning completely
                changes. If our sentence instead said, “Cats chase dogs” then it’s the total opposite meaning of the
                original sentence. Of course there are some cases in English where word order can be changed without
                causing big changes in meaning, but the basic SVO order cannot be tweaked. </p>
