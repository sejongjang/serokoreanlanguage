            <p>Introducing our first two letters: ㄱ and ㅏ. Put them together and we get 가. (Tap for sound).</p>
            <!-- Text box -->
            <div class="card">
                <div class="cardtext">
                    <h1><audio src="../audio/ga.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound(this)">가</a></h1>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>가 is one of thousands of possible character-block combinations in Hangul. (Just like Chinese has
                thousands of possible characters)</p>
            <p>As far as pronunciation goes, the ㄱ sound is closest to the English letter G (as in “go”), but like
                many consonants in Korean it has a sort of split personality that can at times make it sound more
                like a K. <b>Generally, when a ㄱ is the beginning consonant of a word like "개성", then it sounds more like a K than a G.</b></p>
            <p>We’ve created a series of charts to help those visual learners out there wrap your heads around
                this. This really illustrates well how Korean letters stack up against English ones. You can see
                that ㄱ is more of a G sound than it is K sound.</p>
            <!-- Non-expandable image -->
            <div class="boxshadow">
                <img src="../img/g-k.jpg" alt="ㄱ" height="100px">
            </div>
            <p>We also have a mnemonic device for each letter. In the case of ㄱ it’s helpful to remember that is
                has the same basic shape of a lower-case g. Just imagine someone started writing g then got cut
                off.</p>
            <p>The "ㅏ" sound is a no-brainer, it being the same as the English “Ah” sound (as in “auto”). This is
                the only vowel sound we’ll be learning until next chapter as we learn all the main consonants.</p>
            <p>I like to remember this letter as someone with their mouth open and their tongue sticking out. They
                are saying “ahh” as a doctor prepares to check their throat.</p>
