            <p>Introducing our first two letters: ㄱ and ㅏ. Put them together and we get 가. (Tap for sound).</p>
            <!-- Text box -->
            <div class="card">
                <div class="cardtext">
                    <h1><audio src="../audio/ga.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound(this)">가</a></h1>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>가 is one of thousands of possible character-block combinations in Hangul. (Just like Chinese has
                thousands of possible characters)</p>
            <p>As far as pronunciation goes, the ㄱ sound is closest to the English letter G (as in “go”), but l it can at times sound more
                like a K. Many consonants in Korean exhibit this behavior of sounding like two different English letters, depending on their position in a word.</p>
            <p>We’ve created a series of charts to help those visual learners out there wrap your heads around
                this. This really illustrates well how Korean letters stack up against English ones. You can see
                that ㄱ is more of a G sound than it is K sound.</p>
            <!-- Non-expandable image -->
            <div class="boxshadow">
                <img src="../img/g-k.jpg" alt="ㄱ" height="100px">
            </div>
            <p>This is probably a bad example but, ㄱ looks like a <u>G</u>UN. Just imagine someone brandishing this thing at you and yelling "<u>G</u>ET DOWN!"</p>
            <p>The "ㅏ" sound is a no-brainer, it being the same as the English “Ah” sound (as in “auto”). This is
                the only vowel sound we’ll be learning until next chapter as we learn all the main consonants.</p>
