            <p><i>In this chapter we’ll be exploring the uses of a very important new particle—the possessive marker.
                    While possessives in English can be confusing it’s very simple in Korean.

            <p>Jae-young’s bike, Seung-woo’s boat, The flag of South Korea, the first day of school—all of these
                demonstrate possession. The bike is of Jae-young, the flag is of Korea. In communication it is useful to
                categorize things in these ways. It’s an important way to specify the relationships things in the world
                have.


            </p>
            <p>In Korean, ownership and categorization are both expressed through a single, powerful particle—의. This
                particle, like all other Korean particles, sticks onto the end of nouns, and defines that noun’s
                function. We can basically think of 의 as the Korean version of “Apostrophe-S”. This is because 의 follows
                the same order. 재영의 자전거 = Jae-young’s bike. Fortunately 의 doesn’t have any alternate form and stays the
                same whether it comes after a consonant or a vowel. For example 우리의/한국의.
