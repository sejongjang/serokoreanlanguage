            <p>ㄹ is a consonant that tends to be a little tricky for westerners. ㄹ encompasses the “R” sound and the
                “L” sound, but it’s a little bit different than the English R or L. In fact, ㄹ highlights one of the
                great divides between eastern and western language families. It’s cruel, but asking Koreans to
                pronounce words like, “library”, “railroad”, “literature”, or “arbitrary” could make them frustrated.
                This is because there are no equivalent sounds in Korean. The “arr” sound you make when you read words
                like “art”, “cart”, “smart”, etc. is extremely difficult for Koreans to wrap their heads (or rather
                their tongues) around. ㄹ is more simple, and doesn’t require you to tense up the back and sides of your
                tongue like the English R does. </p>
            <p>Another sound that Koreans don’t exactly have is the English “L” sound. In English we usually flick our
                tongue off the back of our top front teeth when we make the L sound at the beginning of words such as
                “love”, “life”, and “lazy”. While this is somewhat similar to the way ㄹ is pronounced, in English
                sometimes we even softly bite the tip of our tongues on L-stop words. Try saying “fall”, and “vail”.
                Koreans never bite their tongues, and instead of the ㄹ sound being a flick off the back of your front
                teeth it’s more of a flick off the roof of your mouth. Imagine rolling your R but stopping after one
                ‘roll’ of the tongue, this is the ㄹ sound. Practice saying “라”, with the front part of your tongue up.
                “라라라라라". 날”(day). In this case you don’t flick your tongue, but you pull it back and it ends up resting
                against the roof of your mouth. So with this L-stop your tongue is moving the way it does when you make
                the L sound, but it’s in the place where you make the R sound. Confused? </p>

            <p>Again, the purpose of these charts is to give you a sense of how Korean letters relate to their English
                counterparts, but ㄹ is very tricky to categorize. You also need to be aware that there’s a different ㄹ
                carry-over sound similar to the ㄹ-stop we just discussed. You can hear what this sounds like below.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>What's going on here is that the ㄹ-stop sound carries over into the next syllable block. These sorts of
                carry-over pronunciations are very common in Korean. When this occurs the last consonant in the
                previous block is
                interacting with the first consonant in the new block. Also be aware that a ㄴ-ㄹ carry-over sound
                is exactly the same as the ㄹ-ㄹ sound. </p>

            <p>With this is mind I regretfully must inform you that like English, Korean also features some homophones
                (words that sound the same but are spelled
                differently). Go ahead and practice these three different ㄹ sounds below, separated into nice
                categories for you.</p>

            <p><i>Whoa! Whoa! Hold the phone, ㄺ?!</i> Indeed. Introducing your first double-badchim "ㄺ". Mismatched
                double letters like ㄺ will only ever come on the bottom of a block. And in the case of ㄺ the ㄹ is
                always silent and only ㄱ is pronounced.</p>
