            <p>Introducing our first two letters: ㄱ and ㅏ. Put them together and we get 가. (Tap for sound).</p>

            <p>가 is one of thousands of possible character-block combinations in Hangul. (Just like Chinese has
                thousands of possible characters)</p>
            <p>As far as pronunciation goes, the ㄱ sound is closest to the English letter G (as in “go”), but like
                many consonants in Korean it has a sort of split personality that can at times make it sound more
                like a K. <b>Overall, Korean sounds tend to be throatier and more back in your mouth than English
                sounds.</b> Note here also that Korean the "ㄱ" sound is slightly stronger than the English "G"
                sound you may be used to.</p>
            <p>We’ve created a series of charts to help those visual learners out there wrap your heads around
                this. This really illustrates well how Korean letters stack up against English ones. You can see
                that ㄱ is more of a G sound than it is K sound.</p>

            <div id="boxshadow">
                <img src="../../img/g-k.jpg" alt="ㄱ" height="100px">
            </div>
            <p>We also have a mnemonic device for each letter. In the case of ㄱ it’s helpful to remember that is
                has the same basic shape of a lower-case g. Just imagine someone started writing g then got cut
                off.</p>
            <p>The "ㅏ" sound is a no-brainer, it being the same as the English “Ah” sound (as in “auto”). This is
                the only vowel sound we’ll be learning until next chapter as we learn all the main consonants.</p>
            <p>I like to remember this letter as someone with their mouth open and their tongue sticking out. They
                are saying “ahh” as a doctor prepares to check their throat.</p>
