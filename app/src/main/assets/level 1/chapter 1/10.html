            <p>Great work so far we're more than halfway done with the main consonants now. Next up to bat we’ve got
                the Korean version of the “J” sound.</p>

            <p>ㅈ follows the pattern of being more light and poppy than the heavy English “J” sound we're used to in
                words
                like, “judge”, “John”, “jade”, etc. Think instead of the “J” sound you make in words like “gene”,
                “jitter”, “Jeff”. This sound is going to border very closely to the English “Ch” sound, and in many
                cases if a word begins with a ㅈ, English speakers will actually here a “Ch” sound.
                <b>The important thing to understand here is that ㅈ, and all the consonants we've learned up to this
                    point (ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅅ, and ㅇ) have been non-aspirated sounds.</b></p>

            <p>What is aspiration? Let's try an experiment. Hold your hand up in front of you mouth and say these
                words: "pop", "case", and "tell". You felt it right? The first letter of each of these words is
                aspirated, meaning you release a puff of air when you say it. Now hold your hand up again and let's try
                a few more words: "bag", "gone", and "night". <i>How about that, no puff of air!</i> That's because
                these are
                non-aspirated consonant sounds. And just like "bag", "gone", and "night", when you say any of the
                letters we've learned so far(ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅇ and ㅈ) <b>there should be no puff of air.</b> Go
                ahead and test your non-aspirated pronunciation below by holding your hand in front of your mouth and
                reading these words.</p>

            <p>Look at that. In the badchim position ㅈ also makes a t-stop sound. That brings us up to a total of three
                t-stop letters *t-stop explanation POPOUT* (ㄷ, ㅅ, and ㅈ). Things just gets more and more interesting.</p>
                <p>Here we also have one more new compound badchim—ㄵ. The ㅈ in the ㄵ badchim often carries over into the next block as you saw above.</p>
