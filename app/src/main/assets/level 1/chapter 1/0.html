            <p><i>Some people have difficulty dealing with change or new things. If you’re one of those people then
                    just believe me, this is a good change. Introducing the best writing system in the world—Hangul
                    (lit. “Korean writing”). It’s arguably more consistent, more logical, and easier to learn than any
                    other writing system in the world. In fact, the hardest part is just going to be pronouncing it
                    right.</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <p>So where did this amazing writing system come from and why have I never heard of it? The creation of
                Hangul is credited to the legendary King Sejong (세종대왕) who was born in AD 1397. Before the times of
                King Sejong, Koreans were completely reliant on borrowed Chinese characters. Chinese writing had been
                adapted, albeit messily, to work with Korean.</p>
            <p>I know what you’re wondering. <i>Why, if they already had a writing system, did King Sejong up and
                decide to invent a new one?</i> First of all, if you’ve ever tried to learn Chinese characters
                you’ll understand that it’s a non-trivial task (to put it lightly). Basically, you have to remember
                thousands of unique characters, many with more than ten strokes. Even natives spend years learning how
                to read and write fluently. This was also true in Korea, where only the upper class could afford the
                long and expensive education required to learn to read and write. </p>
            <p>Secondly, despite Western stereotypes about Asian languages, the fact is that Chinese and Korean are
                fundamentally different languages with different roots, sounds, sentence structure, etc. It’s not an
                exaggeration to say that it would be as difficult to figure out a way to write English in Chinese
                characters as it was to write Korean in Chinese characters. Nevertheless, given no viable alternative,
                the Koreans had since ancient times been using Chinese characters to write. What a headache!</p>
            <p>So along comes King Sejong, who decides to do something to address these problems. He wants to create a
                writing system that is easy enough to be accessible to the lower class (those with limited educational
                opportunity), and one that gives Korea a greater sense of national identity. While many people have
                invented new alphabets and languages throughout history, what made the difference in adoption here is
                that this time it was done by royalty, and it was done in an extremely logical and scientific way. </p>
            <p>Historically Korea has received relatively minimal attention internationally, however since the
                invention of Hangul it’s gained tremendous prestige and Korea is playing an ever more important role
                politically, economically, and especially culturally in the modern world. More and more people are
                learning about Korea and how’s it’s unique from its bigger and traditionally more influential
                neighbors, China and Japan.</p>
            <p><i>*AUTHOR NOTE* We hope you don’t mind these little historical tidbits. We firmly believe that history
                and culture are so closely intertwined with languages that you can’t really gain a good
                understanding of one without the others. We promise all this information will be useful later on.
                So now we can really get to the meat and potatoes of Hangul. </i></p>
