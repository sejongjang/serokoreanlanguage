            <p>This next letter, ㅇ, is very important. </p>

            <p>As you've just heard, when ㅇ comes before a vowel it acts as a silent placeholder. This allows you to
                make a vowel sound without any accompanying consonant sound. This feature of ㅇ is surprisingly well
                used in Korean, and there are a great number of vocabulary words that have no consonant sounds, only
                vowel sounds.</p>
            <p>So what if ㅇ comes after a vowel?</p>

            <!-- Audio text box -->
            <div class="card">
                <div class="cardtext">
                    <h1><audio  src="../../audio/ang.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound(this)">앙</a></h1>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>It turns out that when ㅇ appears as a badchim it actually makes an “ng” sound. In English the common
                “ng” ending is
                presented as two letters (running, long, bang, etc.), but in Korean it is treated as one sound. This
                “ng” sound is quite similar to the English one, just try and pronounce it more in the back of your
                throat.</p>
            <p>Once again there's no comparable letter here so we won't be needing a comparison chart. It may be
                helpful to remember ㅇ as looking like the number 0 i.e. it makes "zero sound". Go ahead and try to
                sound out the stuff below now.</p>

            <p>You can be grateful since ㅇ isn't found in any compound-badchim, but it does have another interesting
                property that you will have just discovered. The reason we said ㅇ acts like a placeholder (and not just
                a silent letter) is because it's place really can be taken by other consonants. <b> When we have a word
                like 닫아, the ㄷ carries over into the next block and take the ㅇ's place. We call this a carry-over
                sound.</b> That's why 아사/앗아 and 다다/닫아 are pronounced the same way. There are a few unusual
                exceptions to this rule, but for now just know that this is the rule.</p>
            <p>The astute reader will also have noticed there's something a little special going on with "라아". In this
                case there is no consonant that can take over ㅇ's spot. Instead the second "아" sound acts to make the
                vowel pronuncation longer. However, in Korean these types of words are often abbrevated back to a
                single length vowel(라), so you won't see this too much.</p>
