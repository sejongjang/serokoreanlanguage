                            var sound10 = document.getElementById("audio10");

            <p>That’s right, ㅎ corresponds to the English “H” sound, as found in words like “heat”, “harsh”, and
                “hoot”. In this unique case, ㅎ's non-aspirated partner ㅇ does not make a similar sound. That’s not to
                say that there’s no relation between the two, however. The shape of the mouth is actually very similar
                when ㅎ and ㅇ appear at the beginning of a syllable block. The difference is that you’re blowing air out
                of your mouth with ㅎ (aspirated). Again with ㅎ there’s no other letter sound to compare it to than H,
                so sorry—you’re out of luck if you wanted a chart.</p>
            <p>ㅎ is also a bit of an exception to the add-one-line-to-make-aspirated rule. In this case you add two
                lines. If you have a
                hard time remembering it, just
                remember ㅎ is ㅇ’s aspirated partner that likes to wear a <b>h</b>at.</p>

            <p>I know you wanted to end this chapter easily, but ㅎ has some mysterious powers and behaviors we need to
                talk about. The first thing to notice is the carry-over sound ㅎ makes in words like 닳아. The rule here
                is that when ㅎ comes before a ㅇ it becomes silent like ㅇ. If it come after ㅇ it isn't silenced because ㅇ's
                "ng" pronunciation doesn't silence the ㅎ. Instead we will have it's regular "H" pronunciation.
                Also, since we brought up 닳아, you can see that ㅀ is our
                final compound badchim. This one is fairly well used.</p>
            <p>The next thing to note is that ㅎ has an unusual effect on nearby non-aspirated consonants. Listen to 갛게
                and 갖하 again. They are actually pronounced as 가케 and 가차! <b>When ㅎ meets a non-aspirated letter that
                    has
                    an aspirated counterpart, it magically transforms it into the aspirated version!</b> Mindblowing
                right?</p>
                <p>Finally, when ㅎ is in the badchim position and it can't carry-over it is silent (as you saw above with "맣"). This bevahior is just like what happens when H comes at the end of an English word, for example "messiah".</p>
