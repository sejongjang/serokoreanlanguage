            <p>By now you’ll have noticed that Hangul seems a lot boxier (sort of like Chinese) than most other
                alphabet-based languages. This is because Hangul is a kind of hybrid between character-based writing
                systems and alphabet-based writing systems. It takes the best of both worlds while also minimizing many
                of the difficulties inherent in both systems. We’ve already told you that Hangul is the Korean
                alphabet, but unlike most western alphabets the letters in Hangul are no good on their own. <b>Hangul
                    is made up of blocks of letters.</b> Each block forms one character.</p>
            <p>What does that mean? Well in English, words are written by stringing letters together followed by spaces
                to separate words. Now imagine if instead of organizing letters this way, we put them into square
                blocks. Each block would be pronounced as one syllable, and spaces between words would be maintained.
                What would the result be like? Well...</p>

            <img id="myImg" src="../../img/hanglish.png" alt="How English would look if it were organized like Hangul." style="width:100%;max-width:600px">

            <!-- The Modal -->
            <div id="myModal" class="modal">

                <!-- The Close Button -->
                <span class="close">&times;</span>

                <!-- Modal Content (The Image) -->
                <img class="modal-content" id="img01">

                <!-- Modal Caption (Image Text) -->
                <div id="caption"></div>
            </div>
            <p>Now compare that with the same phrase in Korean. *이렇게 비슷해보일 수도 있어요.*</p>

            <p>You can see that English letters have to be awkwardly stretched and squashed for each syllable to fit
                into one imaginary square block. At first glance, a system like this may seem cumbersome but there are
                clear advantages. First of all, putting letters into blocks allows more letters fit into a smaller
                space. It does take a bit more vertical real estate than regular English writing, but it saves a ton of
                space horizontally. Secondly, you don’t have to guess how many syllables a word has, as each block
                represents exactly one syllable. That means pronunciation is simplified. Sound like a decent system?
                Yeah, King Sejong thought so too.</p>
            <p>Unlike English writing, King Sejong designed Korean from the ground up to fit into these character
                blocks. As a result, <b>Korean letters were made to stretch and warp into shape, depending on their
                    position in the block.</b> Given that these letters are meant to change shape, their design lends
                itself to the task.</p>
            <p>Now let’s get started learning the actual letters and their pronunciation, but remember, <b>at least one
                    consonant a
                    nd one vowel must be combined to make a valid block.</b> Next chapter I’ll also be
                showing you how multiple consonants and multiple vowels all combine. For this chapter however, we’ll
                stick to one vowel sound while I teach you the consonants.</p>
