                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Perhaps you’ve heard of languages which are
                        complicated by a system of formalities. You may have
                        even heard that learning languages like Korean basically implies learning multiple languages at
                        one time. Fortunately, that's an exaggeration… sort of. Officially there are seven (count them,
                        seven!) levels of speech in Korean. They encompass formal and informal situations, close
                        relationships and first-time meetings, written language and spoken language, as well as language
                        meant for dealing specifically with interactions with royalty. These speech levels are such an
                        integral part of the language that you can’t really teach Korean without talking about this
                        early on.</i></p>

            </div>
            <div class="mstandardpara">

                <p>While formality levels certainly sounds overwhelming at first, you need not be overly concerned.
                    After all, English and all other languages do have some similar characteristics, albeit English is
                    not officially divided into speech levels. Consider that in English you usually change the way you
                    speak depending on who you’re talking to. For example, you don’t use the latest slang when speaking
                    with your grandparents. They aren’t likely to understand it, and you might even get scolded for
                    speaking disrespectfully.


                </p>
                <p>So, in English, we change the way we speak depending on our audience. While English speakers sort of
                    do this unconsciously, in Korean you can’t speak without making a choice about how politely or
                    intimately you want to come off. Furthermore, <b>in Korean you don’t just change your speech based
                        on
                        who you’re talking to, but also based on who you’re talking about.</b>

                </p>
                <p>Foreigners can (no, will definitely) have difficulty navigating the complex social structure woven
                    throughout Korean society, but never fear. I’ve simplified things so that you’ll have some solid
                    guidelines to ensure you never offend anyone. Also remember that even though Korea has the most
                    rigid Confucian societal structure in the world, they’re likely to be quite forgiving of your
                    mistakes. In fact they’ll love you all the more for trying to learn their language.
