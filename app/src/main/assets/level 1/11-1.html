                <p>Before we get into what is located in korean homes an essential skill to have is understanding how to
                    get there in the first place! Finding address' in our home countries are already hard enough let
                    alone trying to do the same in foreign ones. Korea's zoning and adress systems differ very widely
                    for the most part with many western countries, states, cities, and towns.</p>
                <p>In order to find an address in Korea without the help of the internet we need to understand how
                    Korea's provinces and cities are organized. The first the thing to know is that Korea has 8
                    provinces and 9 administrative districts around highly populated cities or autonomus administrative
                    regions that all have representatives in Korea's congress or parliament.</p>
                <p>This is quite confusing but let's learn some vocab so we can start figuring out how everything is
                    organized what it's called.</p>

                <p>All of these terms may be difficult to wrap your head around how they work together to tell you the

                <p>Starting to make a little more sense right?! The Korean address system is actually very logical as
                    you can locate any building in the country on a map just by knowing the city, district, and
                    subdivision it is located in. Good luck trying to find where "334 W Washington Rd.
                    Seattle, WA" is without the internet's help. So if you ever get used to it then you probably will
                    wish every country did their address' like this.</p>
                <p>Besides Seoul and provinces, all other administrative districts are 광역시s except for 2 special cases.
                    Sejong (세종) and Jeju (제주). 제주특별자치도 is Jeju Special Autonomus Province and 세종특별자치시 is Sejong Special
                    Autonomus City, but why are they identified as such?</p>
                <p>Despite it's small population of just over 600,000, jeju is too far away from any province and too
                    different in culture to be anything but a self ruling (autonomous) entity. Sejong is a very special
                    case being constructed from nothing and, having opened in just 2012, already has over 300,000
                    residents. The city was constructed to replace Seoul as the capital of South Korea as the world's
                    longest building was constructed there and now houses a majority of the government's ministries that
                    were previously located in Seoul. It is probably the most modern and cleanest place you will ever
                    see in Korea!</p>
