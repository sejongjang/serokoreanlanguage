            <p>Short answer: Yes, someday.</p>
            <p>Long answer: Both countries still intend to reunite with each other. Of course they disagree about how
                such a reunification would be accomplished and what form of government would be formed following
                reunification. At this point these disagreements are so pronounced that it seems like there is little
                possibility of imminent reunification. Adding to the difficulty is the fact that the longer countries
                remain separate, the more the rising generations view them as fundamentally different and separate from
                their neighbors.
            </p>
            <p> The South is currently split on the topic of reunification. Only 50-60% of South Koreans desired
                unification as of 2018, for reasons ranging from being the same race to potential increased economic
                prosperity. One of the most planned out ideas for potential unification between the countries come in
                the form of a federalist system of government. Just like in the United States there is a federal
                government that oversees regional governments of states and provinces that have limited powers to
                control certain things within their own borders.</p>

            <p>The proposal would establish a federal government over the entire korean peninsula comprised of
                officials from both countries based on population. Two (communist north and capitalist south) or several
                provincial governments based upon current provincial boundaries would be set up using the economic/
                socio
                political system of their choice. This seems far fetched, but China has already been experimenting with
                having different socio political systems within its own country in the example of Hong Kong being
                autonomous
                from the rest of the mainland after the United Kingdom relinquished it in 1997. North Korea also
                attempted
                as a similar autonomous state in that of Sinuiju (신의주) where free trade and more economic freedom would
                be
                allowed to generate more GDP growth, despite the project ending in failure.</p>
            <p>You might say that this idea seems far-fetched and you would be correct. There have been no serious
                considerations for this plan in the UN or between the two Koreas. The United States and the rest of the
                UN is currently playing long term games with the north, waiting for the country to completely collapse
                economically before converting the country into a democratic capitalist society like their southern
                neighbors, eventually giving control back to south korea and eventually unifying the peninsula once
                again.
