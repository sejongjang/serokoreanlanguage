                        pronunciation, spelling, and what-have-you, we’ll
                        also be taking some breathers here and there to help you refresh your mind and give you time to
                        absorb what you’ve learned so far. These culture chapters will also serve the secret purpose of
                        making you better at Korean. Wait what? It turns out that knowing how to talk to
                        Koreans doesn’t do you much good if you don’t know what to talk to them about. Like we said,
                        language, culture, and history are inseparably intertwined. We’ll have you not just talking
                        like,
                        but also thinking like a Korean in no time.</i></p>

                    let's talk
                    about one of the main reasons this app
                    exists
                    and
                    the reason many people become interested in learning Korean. That reason is 한류(韓流), otherwise
                    known
                    in
                    English as <i>the Korean Wave</i>.</p>
                <p>What is the Korean Wave? Put simply, it’s everything Korean that is taking the world by storm.
                    Starting about twenty years ago (with roots going back even further), Korean products, food, and
                    most notably
                    movies,
                    music, and television began gaining serious international recognition. Since then the
                    Korean
                    Wave
                    has
                    only gotten bigger and gained more momentum.</p>
                <p>You must have noticed some of those big name brands in the vocabulary list but you might not have
                    know they were Korean! Now you know the proper way to pronounce these company names when you go to
                    buy a new phone or car.</p>

                <p>Famous korean foods such as bulgogi, bibimbap, and korean barbeque buffets are also gaining extreme
                    popularity in the America's and Europe. We won't go into detail on food here because we're going to
                    hit it hard in chapter 16 but just keep in mind that food is also one aspect of 한류.</p>
                <p>The most notable aspect of this wave of Korean culture may be Korean music and dramas. In a world
                    dominated by Hollywood and western culture, many people have found Korean entertaiment to
                    be
                    refreshing and new. K-pop music videos are colorful, shiny, and enthralling. The stories in Korean
                    dramas are character-driven and uplifting. Korean
                    directors rely less on
                    splashy
                    special effects and more on impressively talented and good-looking actors and actresses,
                    coupled
                    with hearty writing. If you’ve never watched a Korean drama the time has come.
                    We'll just
                    warn you that they can be extremely addictive!</p>
