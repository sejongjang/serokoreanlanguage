            <p>There’s also an unusual phenomenon that’s almost unique to the Korean entertainment industry. The
                versatility of these stars allows them to do everything. It’s not unusual for a celebrity to be
                involved in a band, film, drama, lend their voice in creation of the soundtrack for the drama, appear
                in product-endorsement commercials, participate in comedy shows, and model for fashion shows and
                magazines all at the same time! While many western celebrities are typically limited to just acting, or
                just singing, you’ll be astonished to see your favorite star doing everything and appearing everywhere
                on TV and the internet in Korea. And the really crazy thing is that many of these stars succeed in
                doing it all. Let me give you a couple examples. </p>

            <p>Here’s 정은지, from Busan, showing off her southern accent in a role that won her a “Best New Actress”
                award, singing an OST for the same show, dancing, modeling. </p>
            <p>Impressed yet? Koreans seem to have an innate understanding of the beauty of humanity. This is a country
                that has gone from extreme poverty to upper-first-world status in a few short decades. That means that
                many adults grew up in much harder conditions than the current rising generation. The struggles of
                poverty and rapid modernization are still vivid in the minds of many Koreans. They place high value in
                families, close friendships, eating together, sharing things, and hard work. These values are reflected
                in the best of Korean film and music. </p>
