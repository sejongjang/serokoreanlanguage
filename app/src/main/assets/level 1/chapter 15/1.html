            <p><b>The second main negator verb form we will learn is ~지 못하다.</b> This one means “cannot” and is added to
                verbs just the same as ~지 않다. Examples of ~지 못하다 can be seen in the following examples
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">
            <p>가지 못했어요<br>
                가지 못해요<br>
                가지 못할거예요<br>
                먹지 못했어요<br>
                먹지 못해요<br>
                먹지 못할거예요
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>However, just like with 않다 there are shorter ways to use 못하다. One is used with nouns and the other is
                attached to verbs just like ~지 못하다.
            </p>
            <p>The negation verb we use with nouns is “못하다". This can be used by itself or put in front of nouns like
                공부(study) and would be seen used like, “공부를 못했어요" meaning “I couldn’t study”. Try using 못하다 with the
                following nouns and make some sentences in past, present, and future tenses!</p>
                <div class="center_context">
            <p>숙제(homework),<br> 운전(drive),<br> 요리(cooking),<br> 등산(hiking),<br> 야구(baseball)
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>Now what do we use with verbs? This is also so simple that most Koreans also use this form in everyday
                conversations. You just add 못 to whatever verb you want and it will negate it. Let’s look at some
                examples.</p>
                <div class="center_context">
                <p> 못가요 (I can’t go),<br> 못먹었어요(I couldn’t eat),<br> 못잘거예요(I won’t be able to sleep),<br> 못봐요(I can’t
                see/watch).</p>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>There is an important difference to recognize between ~지 않다(안하다) and ~지 못하다. When we use 않다 we are saying
                that we choose to not do something or that something did not happen. On the other hand, 못하다 is used to
                express something that cannot be done even if you wanted to. For example, to say “I didn’t do my
                homework” we would say “숙제를 안했어요" denoting that we could have done our homework but chose not to. If we
                say, “숙제를 못했어요" then that means we wanted to do our homework but something prevented us from doing it.
            </p>
            <p><i>
                    Bonus: Koreans sometimes employ double negatives in ways similar to English (it’s also fun like
                    English). For example, Jessica: “She didn’t say she’s leaving.” Jaeyoung: “Well she didn’t say she’s
                    not leaving.”—can be translated as 제시카: “그 사람은 떠난다는 말이 없어요.” 재영: “그러긴 한데 떠나지 않겠다는 말도 없잖아요”. This is
                    a case where the rules of English grammar don’t allow it, but subject is normally assumed from
                    context in Korean.
