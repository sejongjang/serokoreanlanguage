            <p><i>Oops we promised that last chapter was going to be easy but we ended up talking about verbs again.
                    After two difficult chapters we now have the basics of Korean verbs down. And on this solid
                    foundation we’re now going to branch out in many useful directions. Simple positive statements like
                    we’ve been doing are foundational but are very limiting. We’re now going to talk about negation of
                    verbs and some other uniquely-Korean verb constructions that will open up a whole world of
                    expression to you.

            <p>So, we know how to say, “I will go,” but what about “I won’t go”? Just like in English, Korean has a
                couple of ways we can say this. The first thing we need to know however is the verb ending “지”. You can
                sort of think of 지 as a +/- sign. It prepares the verb to be negated or confirmed. Conjugating the verb
                to 지 form is a easy, simply drop the “다” and swap in the “지”.
            </p>

            <p> </p>

            <p></p>
            <div class="center_context">
                <p>Step 1: Drop the 다 <br>
                    가다 → 가<br>
                    먹다 → 먹<br>

                    Step 2: Add 지<br>
                    가 → 가지<br>
                    먹 → 먹지
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>It’s a cinch, right? However just sticking a 지 on the verb doesn’t do much—we also need a negator. Korean
                has two main negator verbs. The first one we’ll learn is “않다”. 않다 can be translated simply as “does
                not”. When combined with “지” we get “~지 않다”. If we use our example verbs and add “지 않다” and conjugate we
                come up with:
            </p>
            <!--add image-->
            <p>So “(He/she) doesn’t go” and “(He/she) doesn’t eat”. Simple enough right? What about past tense and
                future tense? If you are thinking we would conjugate rt the base form to its past or future root form
                and then stick “지 않다” on the end then I have some good news—it’s much more simple than that. You don’t
                have to conjugate the root verb and can instead just put the “않다” in past or future form.
            </p>
            <!--add image-->
            <p>않다 is actually a modern contraction of the verb 아니하다 which is comprised of 아니 meaning “not” and 하다
                meaning “to do”. This is why 않다 is our “does not” verb. With this in mind, let’s take a look at other
                ways we can use “does not” in korean.
            </p>
            <p>Just like what we talked about with 아니하다 being the original verb, modern korean has two more variations
                of it that we can use. One is used with nouns and the other is attached to verbs just like ~지 않다 but it
                is shorter!
            </p>
            <p>The negation verb we use with nouns is “안하다". This can be used by itself or put in front of nouns like
                공부(study) and would be seen used like, “공부를 안했어요" meaning “I didn’t study” or more specifically “I
                didn’t do studying”. Try using 안하다 with the following nouns and make some sentences in past, present,
                and future tenses!
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">
            <p>숙제(homework),<br> 운전(drive),<br> 요리(cooking),<br> 등산(hiking),<br> 야구(baseball)

            </p>
            </div>
            <p>Now how do we use this with verbs? It's so simple that most Koreans use this form in everyday
                conversations. You just add 안 to whatever verb you want and it will negate it. Let’s look at some
                examples. 안가요 (I don’t go), 안먹었어요(I didn’t eat), 안잘거예요(I will not sleep), 안봐요(I don’t see/watch).
