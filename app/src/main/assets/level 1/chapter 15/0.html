            <p><i>Oops we promised that last chapter was going to be easy but we ended up talking about verbs again.
                    After two difficult chapters we now have the basics of Korean verbs down. And on this solid
                    foundation we’re now going to branch out in many useful directions. Simple positive statements like
                    we’ve been doing are foundational but are very limiting. We’re now going to talk about negation of
                    verbs and some other uniquely-Korean verb constructions that will open up a whole world of
                    expression to you.

            <p>So, we know how to say, “I will go,” but what about “I won’t go”? Just like in English, Korean has a
                couple of ways we can say this. The first thing we need to know however is the verb ending “지”. You can
                sort of think of 지 as a +/- sign. It prepares the verb to be negated or confirmed. Conjugating the verb
                to 지 form is a easy, simply drop the “다” and swap in the “지”.
