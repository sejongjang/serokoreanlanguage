                    Korean
                    this chapter will be a little easier. But only a little. Just kidding, I know you are all super
                    geniuses. Without further ado let’s introduce the Chinese version of the numbers 1-10.</i></p>

            <p>So what do you think? It doesn't really resemble the other numbers (하나, 둘, 셋, 넷, 다섯, 여섯, 일곱, 여덟, 아홉,
                열) does it? But not so bad right? One thing you’ll notice about Chinese-based vocabulary is that the
                spelling is more simple. <b>In fact, you will never find double-받침 present in Chinese-based
                    vocabulary.</b>
                Clearly those who converted the Chinese characters into 한글 made efforts to ensure simplification.
                That helps because once you recognize spelling conventions you can more easily determine word
                origin. That will in turn help you know how to deal with the words, as we’ll see later on. Native
                Korean numbers may have evolved in a way a little bit more like the western ones, however the
                Chinese have a very different take on the numbering system. Let me explain.
            </p>
            <p>Have you ever thought about how arbitrary the names we give to numbers are? In English we go from
                one, ten, hundred, and thousand, to ten thousand. So we make a new word the first three times we add
                a
                zero, but then suddenly we combine two existing words to create a new unit, "ten-thousand"? Why do
                we
                do this? Well the answer is, of course, to make things easier. Just imagine if we had to remember a
                new word every time we added a zero. It would probably be quite overwhelming.

                <p><b><i>코디 선생</i></b><br>Learning Korean at first I saw no reason to have two number
                    systems and
                    was very confused in which situations I should use the Korean or Chinese number systems. I
                    realize now
                    you can compare Chinese and Korean to Latin/Greek and English. Our version of the Latin
                    numbers
                    are seen in examples like mono-theism (belief in ONE god), bi-cycle (TWO wheels),
                    tri-dent (THREE-pronged-spear), etc. So now the concept of having two number systems in
                    Korean doesn't seem that weird anymore!
                    If you review chapter 9,
                    you will see that the korean numbers are usually only used for counting things and people up
                    until ~49, age, and
                    orders (first, second, third, etc.). Things like calendar dates, numbers over 49, math, codes,
                    phone numbers and the like
                    will all be in the chinese numbers. So dont worry too much at first, its okay to mess up! When
                    in doubt, just trying using
                    the Chinese. So try to get this system down extra well.</p>

            <p style="margin-right:15px">The break with Chinese-based numbering systems isn’t that they make a new unit every time they add a
                zero—they merely start the new unit creation one zero later. In Chinese numbers you go from one
                (일), to ten (십), to hundred (백), to thousand (천), to another new unit “만”—ten thousand. This means
                that to say 100,000 you don’t say “one-hundred thousand”, rather you would say “ten ten-thousands”.
