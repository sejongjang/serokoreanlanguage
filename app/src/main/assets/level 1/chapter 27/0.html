            <p><i>A super important tool in your tool box of Korean is the connector, ‘and’. We use ‘and’ all the time
                    without even noticing it because it is our “go to” word to use when we want to list multiple things
                    in a sentence. John and I went to the store. Minji and Kyle love ice cream. I would like a sandwich
                    and a soda please. These are just a few examples of everyday sentences where we use ‘and’ to portray
                    multiple subjects and/or objects. Unlike ‘and’ in english where we can use it to connect verbs and
                    other sentences, 와/과 and (이)랑 can only be used in connecting nouns. For example, in english we can
                    say, “I want to run and swim tomorrow”. However, in Korean we have to use VS+고 to connect the verbs
                    to run and to swim. This shows us that 와/과 and (이)랑 can only be used when connecting two nouns, such
                    as in the example, “I like apples and bananas”. In Korean, we can express this as, [저는 사과와 바나나를
                    좋아해요]

            <p>We will start with 와/과 and explain some important points you need to know to be able to use this
                connector like a native. 와/과 is a more polite form of the word, ‘and’, and is used more often in formal
                settings or in writing. With that in mind, also know that 와/과 can be used right before the word 함께 to
                mean ‘together with’ in the example, “I went to Korea with my friend” or “저는 친구와 함께 한국에 갔어요". Together
                can also be expressed with the word 같이 which can be found in later chapters. For right now, what we need
                to know about 와/과 is that 와 is used alongside nouns that end in a vowel(받침 not present) and 과 is used
                with nouns that end in a consonant(받침 present). This can be seen in the following examples.

            <div class="center_context">
                <p>친구<b>와</b>, 민지<b>와</b>, 비행기<b>와</b>, 컴퓨터<b>와</b>, 등<br>
                        책<b>과</b>, 집<b>과</b>, 지갑<b>과</b>, 동생<b>과</b>, 등 
                        </p>
            </div>
            <p>So take a minute and try making some sentences using 와/과 on your own!
