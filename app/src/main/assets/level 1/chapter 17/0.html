            <p>If we were to make a list of the most fundamental and crucial particles in Korean, 에 would definitely be
                in the top five on the list. This is because 에 wields the power to define targets, pinpoint times,
                specify locations and point out directions. If there were no particle to fill this function you would
                never be able to answer the questions “where” or “when”. 에 is going to become one of our well used and
                trusty tools as we progress through learning Korean.
