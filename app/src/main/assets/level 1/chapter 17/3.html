            <p>Since we’re talking about 에 it’s also important that we talk about “서”. We use the marker “서” after 에
                sometimes to indicate that something is actively happening in relation to what you’re marking. So in
                this case there is going to be a game held at the stadium. It sounds a little strange to omit the “서”
                marker here because the sentence sounds very active. You’ll get used to it as you see it more. Anyway, 에
                is always used when marking the place something occurs.
