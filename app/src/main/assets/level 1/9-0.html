                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Numbers are an important part of any language. As you know numbers are used for things like telling
                    time, expressing how many of something there is, asking how much something costs, and saying how
                    old or how tall you are.</i></p>

                Although Korean was it’s own functioning language before the adoption of Chinese characters for
                writing, it turns out that Chinese had a lot of useful words that hadn’t yet been contrived in the
                Korean language. Because of this the Koreans eventually came to adopt a huge number of Chinese
                vocabulary into the Korean language, along with the Chinese characters. In order to achieve this, they
                took the original Chinese words and Korean-ized them to match the sounds in the Korean language. Even
                today there are many words in Korean that sound similar to their Chinese counterpart but match Korean
                pronunciation conventions.</p>
            <p>Just how much Chinese did Korea borrow? Many estimates indicate that <b>more than half of Korean vocabulary
                is based in Chinese!</b> The good news about this is that Chinese has one of the most logical systems of
                vocabulary creation in the world. Like in English, we often figure out what an unfamiliar word means by
                looking at it’s roots, you can easily do the same with many Chinese-based words. Granted you will be
                learning a whole new system of language roots, but I’ll be helping to point out root character meanings
                and you’ll figure it out in no time. Here’s an example chart with the Chinese root character 국 meaning
                country.</p>
