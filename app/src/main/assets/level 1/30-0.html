                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>You made it! You have officially reached the end of Sero Korean Level 1 and wasn’t it a journey?
                    You have learned everything from how to read and write Korean to how to describe the environment
                    around you in just a few short lessons. You probably still feel pretty inadequate but that feeling
                    is normal. These past 29 chapters were meant to give you a cultural and grammatical foundation that
                    you can easily build off of moving forward toward conversational fluency. Utilizing the lessons
                    learned here in level 1 future concepts will be understood easier, it will take less time to become
                    comfortable speaking, and your cultural knowledge will not only aide you in grasping difficult
                    lingual concepts but impress Koreans you meet and help you develop bonds and relationships moreFragment
                    deeply and quickly.</i></p>

        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his is the part where normally we make a shameless plug for you to move on to level 2 of Sero Korean.
                And while it's true that we do hope for you to do that and keep going on this journey with us in the
                future, we also must recongize that there are a lot of other good resources for learning Korean out
                there as well.
            </p>
            <p>We'd also like to recommend our favorite method of all—the immersion method. You can do this by getting out
                on the streets and riding the public
                transportation of Korea and talking to strangers about all sorts of topics. This is obviously very
                indimidating for some people and is a method that should be used with discretion but it's hard to think
                of a better way to become comfortable speaking, which is probably what most people who learn a language 
                for fun are most interested in being able to do. 
            </p>
            <p>If anything in level 1 or succeeding levels doesn't quite make sense, we also have the additional study
                videos intended to provide comprehensive and concise explanations of concepts, rules, and culture to
                help you along your journey to becoming fluent. Also any questions may be directed to Sero Language on
                social media. Hopefully you feel moreFragment empowered by your knowledge of Korean and Korea itself after
                working through the past 29 chapters. Levels 2 and 3 will go over in even moreFragment detail concepts and forms
                hinted at in level 1 and ways to put everything you just learned into full sentences. Now that your
                foundation is set, we can go ahead and start working away at making you conversational in our
                intermediate and advanced levels so that you can discover what Korea really has to offer you.
