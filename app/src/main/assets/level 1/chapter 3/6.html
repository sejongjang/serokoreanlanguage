            <p>Hurray, you're finally done learning 한글! And you didn't just learn it, you killed it!</p>
            <p>Now that we have learned how to read Korean we will be able to start digging into Korean grammar. First
                though, we'll take a little break next chapter to talk about the Korean wave. This will also be a
                chance for you to start picking up some vocabulary.</p>
            <p>Go ahead and review below and take the chapter 3 quiz!</p>
            <ul><b>
                    <li>Adding a line onto vowels that have one protruding line adds a "Y" sound in front of the vowel
                        (아-야, 어-여, 오-요, 우-유, 애-얘, and 에-예).</li>
                    <li>으 and 이 don't have y-vowel versions.</li>
                    <li>The compound vowels in 한글(Hangul) are 와, 워, 외, 위, 의, 왜, and 웨.</li>
                    <li>외, 왜, and 웨 all sound the same.</li>
                    <li>에 and 애 sound very similar, and so does 의 when it is acting as a possesive marker.</li>
                    <li>At the beginning (or middle) of a word 의 is pronounced as "으-이", and at the end of a word it
                        just makes an "이" sound.</li>
                    <li>Badchim spelled out in Korean is 받침, and Hangul is 한글.</li>

                        dog.” It turns out Korean also has an entertaining pangram, including all the single consonants and
                        vowels (only a couple of compounds are included): <br>키스의 고유 조건은 입술끼리 만나야 되고 특별한 요령은 필요치 않다.<br>
