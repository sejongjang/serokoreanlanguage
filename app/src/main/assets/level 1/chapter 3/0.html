            <p><i>While 한글 is highly logical and extremely easy to learn there are a few more mysterious behaviors and
                    letters we need to talk about in this short chapter before moving on. After finishing this chapter
                    you'll be able to read all but the most obscure or rare 한글 (the kind of stuff natives don't know
                    how to read for sure either).</i></p>

        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <p>In Chapter 1 we talked
                about regular consonants and aspirated consonants. There are five regular consonants—ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅇ, and
                ㅈ—which have aspirated versions (ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ). You remember that aspirated letters have another line
                added, but it turns out that four of these letters—ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, and ㅈ—as well as another consonant, ㅅ, all
                have a "tensed" version. These tensed-cosonants are made by doubling the letter. The first one we'll
                look at is ㄲ.</p>

            <p>You can feel it right? There’s something to these tensed consonants that isn’t there in non-tensed ones.
                There are two problems you’ll encounter here, however. First, on the listening front you may be able to
                hear the difference when it’s clearly enunciated for you like this, but Koreans talk fast. You have to
                be able to distinguish tensation in regular conversation, which is much more difficult.
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when it comes to pronouncing these tensed consonants, foreigners tend to just say the original
                consonant but louder. Please take this to heart now, because it can save you from embarrassment later.
                <b>Tensed consonants are not pronounced by saying them louder than their regular counterparts.</b> But
                if they’re not
                louder, what’s different about them? </p>
            <p>Listen below and then let's talk some more.</p>

            <p>Essentially there are two distinguishing factors between regular consonants and tensed ones. The first
                thing is that tensed consonants start a little higher than normal. While Korean gratefully has no
                system of tones like Thai or Chinese do, one thing about these double consonants is that they do have a
                sort of falling tone to them. Again, listen carefully and try to replicate.</p>
            <p>The other thing about tensed consonants is that they have a different timing to them than regular
                letters do. It’s almost as if you take an ever so tiny pause right before you say the letter. This adds
                tension. It’s like pulling back just a little bit harder on a rubber band before launching it at your
                unsuspecting target. Since this tension builds up a little bit longer, the release is a little bit more
                dramatic. Again, this doesn’t really mean louder, just different.</p>

                <p style="padding-right:10px;padding-left:15px;text-indent:0em;"> When I got to Korea and began
                    speaking with many people I was able to start hearing the
                    difference between regular and tensed-consonants fairly quickly, but it took a couple of years
                    and tons of practice to figure out exactly how to pronounce these tensed consonants in a way
                    that made it so Koreans knew which letter I was saying. It turns out that if I had just known about these
                    two fairly easy guidelines I would have been able to ensure that Koreans knew whether I
                    mean 굴 or 꿀 from the beginning. You, lucky reader, get this information
                    without having to figure it out for yourself the hard way.</p>
