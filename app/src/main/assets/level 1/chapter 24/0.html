            <p><i>We haven’t been able to talk much about conjunctions in Korean yet, aside from learning a bit about
                    “고”. This chapter we’ll be diving into the most common ways of saying “because” in Korean. This will
                    allow us to begin to give reasons for things and making longer, more-complete ideas.

            <p>In Korean there are multiple ways to express the reason for things. English is similar—there’s actually
                quite a few words we can use besides, “because”. Think of words like “since”, “therefore”, “so”, “due
                to”, “by reason of”, “for”, etc. etc. We can actually make a very long list of words that can be used to
                express reasons for things, and they all have slightly different nuances. Unfortunately, it’s possible
                to make a similarly long list in Korean.

            </p>
            <p>The good news is that there are a couple of forms you can use that pass in most situations, so we’ll be
                learning the most common forms of “because’ here in this chapter and then be picking up some more in the
                future.
