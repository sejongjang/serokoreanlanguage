            <p>Memorizing the prepositions is the easy part while knowing in what fashion they fit into a grammatically
                coherent sentence is what we are going to be focusing on. In the typical sentence describing the
                location of something, in English, we may use “It is behind the chair” which is equivalent to
                Pronoun+verb+preposition+object(noun). We use the pronoun ‘it’ to represent the thing we are describing
                the location of. We then use the verb ‘to be’ conjugated as ‘is’ to represent the existence of that
                thing in whose location is being described, without the verb, “It behind the chair” sounds pretty
                primitive right? We may now use the preposition of our choice! In this case, we will use the preposition
                behind or 뒤 in our example. Lastly, we state the object that the thing being described is above, under,
                or in this case, behind.

            </p>
            <p>Now that we know, in detail, the parts of the english sentence, let's take a look at the same sentence in
                Korean. “의자 뒤에 있어요". If you’re already analyzing and comparing the two sentences you may notice that the
                Korean sentence is lacking the pronoun ‘it’ present in the english. That is because in Korean most nouns
                or pronouns are unnecessary in context.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you and your friend are talking about a restaurant you would like to go to, and your
                friend asks, “where is Johnny’s Pizza?” most of the time you will not respond with, “Johnny’s Pizza is
                downtown” but rather, “It is downtown”. In context, your friend knows ‘it’ is referring to the
                restaurant ‘Johnny’s Pizza’ and not another restaurant, so there is not need to say it again. So it is
                with Korean but even more simplified in that you do not even need to use a pronoun most of the time.
                This is shown in the Korean example sentences, “여기 있어요" “학교 가요" and “좀 비싸요". Out of context you may be
                confused on who or what the subject of the sentence is, but in context it is a big time saver.
            </p>
            <p>The next part of our sentence, “의자 뒤에 있어요", is 의자 meaning chair. In Korean, we put the object at the
                front of the sentence. You also may have noticed the lack of ‘the’. ‘The’ is non-existent in Korean
                despite maybe being used as konglish in the form of ‘더’. After we place the object we add in our
                preposition of choice followed by 에 when describing location or (으)로 when describing directions. Lastly,
                we finish the sentence with our verb. However instead of the verb used in english, ‘to be’, Korean uses
                the verb ‘있다’ or ‘to exist’. So anytime you may use the verb ‘is’ when describing the location of
                something, just know, it is probably ‘있어요' instead. Step by step process give us this result.
