                <p>Now let’s consider another sentence.
                </p>

                <div class="center_context">
                    <p>Sarah, who’s a girl, is pretty. <br>
                        여자인 사라가 예뻐요.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>It turns out that we can also use the copula, “이다”, in a way similar to other adjectives. If we put
                    the
                    ㄴ adjective modifier on 이다 it becomes tense-neutral and serves to describe what something is with no
                    regard to when, thus becoming 인. This helps us to associate two nouns together. For example, in
                    English we sometimes have
                    to clarify the difference between “boyfriend” and “my friend who’s a boy,” you can do this same
                    thing in
                    Korean.


                </p>
                <div class="center_context">
                    <p>남자 친구 - boyfriend <br>
                        남자인 친구 - friend, who is a boy<br>
                        The slang version is "남사친" or "여사친" which is short for "남자(여자) 사람 친구"

                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>Here are some other examples of when this is useful.

                </p>
                <div class="center_context">
                    미국 사람인 우리 아빠 - "My dad, who is american"<br>
                    24살인 저 - "I, who am 24 years old"

                </div>
                <p><i>*Before moving on we’ll tell you about one moreFragment crucially important adjective. The adjective 같다
                        means
                        “to be like”. I’m telling you about this because it’s used frequently for equivocation like 이다
                        is. 같다 means "to be the same, identical, or equal" and so is perfect for this! You will see 같다
                        used all the time in later grammar forms like ~ㄹ 것 같다 but let's stick with this for right
                        now.<br>

                        <div class="center_context">

                      어머니 같은 여자 - "motherly girl"<br>
                        천재 같은 학생 - "student genious"<br>
                        *바보 같은 놈 - "idiotic jerk"</div>
