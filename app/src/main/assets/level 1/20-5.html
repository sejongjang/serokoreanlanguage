            <p>This is one of the most heartbreaking parts of the division of the two Koreas. After the end of World War
                II, Korea was immediately caught up in the tensions of the Cold War. The Soviet Union had taken control
                of the North, just as they had done with Eastern Berlin and Eastern Europe at the fall of Nazi Germany,
                in order to spread Communism throughout the rest of the continent. The United States took control of the
                South to block any communist influence from reaching South Korea. From late 1945 until modern day,
                crossing the DMZ (demilitarized zone) has been strictly forbidden and risks being shot on sight by North
                Korean soldiers if caught. So, family members who were on one side or the other before the border was
                made has lived in isolation from the rest of their family ever since. No communication of any kind
                between family in the South is allowed by the North Korean government making these separations almost
                unbearable. There have been a few special meetings for a select number of older citizens of both
                countries to meet at a secure location and share memories and enjoy each others company once again.
