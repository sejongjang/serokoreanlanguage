                    up. It requires little to no brain power, so just read and absorb.

            <p>을/를 is the direct object marker. This allows you to specify what the target of the verb is. The direct
                object marker usually behaves exactly like you’d expect, so we could almost just end the chapter here
                (hehe). Remember Korean is SOV word order, so the object marker will show up between the subject and the
                verb.

            <p>Look at this!! You are making and reading real, complex sentences now! How great! Also note that in many
                cases you will also have the subject dropped out because it can be assumed from context.

            </p>
            <!--add graphic-->
            <p>There are also many cases in which it’s acceptable to drop the 을/를 marker out of the sentence. Some
                everyday statements are so simple that it would be impossible to confuse the noun in the sentence as
                anything other than the object. Look at these examples</p>
            <div class="center_context">
            <p>떡 싫어해요<br>
                노래 불러요 - (sounds like a command)<br>
                소식 들었어요<br>
                밥 먹었어요<br>
                재영씨 믿을거에요*<br>
                사랑니 뽑을거에요.
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>Let’s take a quick look at the sentence “재영씨 믿을거에요.” The truth is that this sentence could be interpreted
                in two ways depending on context. Because 재영 is a noun that could reasonably be doing the acting, or
                being acted upon, one way to interpret this is to view 재영씨 as the subject of the sentence. (재영씨가 믿을거에요.)
                In that case we don’t know what he’s going to believe, but the speaker is asserting that 재영 is highly
                likely to believe. Since it’s ㄹ/을것이다 future-tense form, it’s a definitive statement that the speaker
                essentially views as a certainty.
            </p>
            <p>The other way we can interpret this sentence is to assume 재영씨 is the object of the sentence, and the
                subject is assumed from context. (재영씨를 믿을거에요). The best way to understand this sentence would be by
                putting the assumed subject in the sentence. “제시카가 재영씨를 믿을거에요". In this case the speaker is asserting
                that Jessica will believe whatever Jaeyoung is going to tell her. It sounds very reassuring.
            </p>
            <p>One thing we should warn you about—ㄹ/을것이다 is not used when making assertions about your own behavior. It
                makes sense if you think about it too, becuase ㄹ/을것이다 form is essentially a strong prediction. ㄹ/을게요, a
                slightly different form is used as positive assertion of one’s intention. I don’t know how this form
                evolved, but you can see that it’s similar to the ㄹ/을것이다 form. (It’s worth noting that Koreans sometimes
                spell the ㄹ/을게요 form as ㄹ/을께요 since it is usually pronounced with a strong ㄲ type sound, however the
                correct spelling is ㄹ/을게요)
            </p>
            <p>“제가 재영씨(를) 믿을게요". (Obejct marker is unnecessary.)</p>
