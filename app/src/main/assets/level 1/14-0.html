                        stress-inducing, so here’s a chapter that's bound to cheer you
                        up. It requires little to no brain power, so just read and absorb.

                    This allows you to specify what the target of the verb is. The direct
                    object marker usually behaves exactly like you’d expect, so we could almost just end the chapter
                    here. Remember Korean is SOV word order, so the object marker will show up between the subject and
                    the
                    verb.

                <!--add graphic-->
                <p>There are also many cases in which it’s acceptable to drop the 을/를 marker out of the sentence. Some
                    everyday statements are so simple that it would be impossible to confuse the noun in the sentence as
                    anything other than the object. Look at these examples</p>

                <p>Let’s take a quick look at the sentence “재영씨 믿을거에요.” The truth is that this sentence could be
                    interpreted
                    in two ways depending on context. Because 재영 is a noun that could reasonably be doing the acting, or
                    being acted upon, one way to interpret this is to view 재영씨 as the subject of the sentence. (재영씨가
                    믿을거예요.)
                    In that case we don’t know what he’s going to believe, but the speaker is asserting that 재영 is
                    highly
                    likely to believe. Since it’s ㄹ/을것이다 future-tense form, it’s a definitive statement that the speaker
                    essentially views as a certainty.
                </p>
                <p>The other way we can interpret this sentence is to assume 재영씨 is the object of the sentence, and the
                    subject is assumed from context. (재영씨를 믿을거에요). The best way to understand this sentence would be by
                    putting the assumed subject in the sentence. “제가 재영씨를 믿을거예요". In this case the speaker is asserting
                    that they will believe whatever Jaeyoung is going to tell them. In all the example sentences "I" or
                    the subject based on context of the previous sentences is implied and therefore is not necessary to
                    be included. If we use a previous example, in the case that we are talking about fruits that we eat
                    and someone says "사과 먹어요" then it would mean "I eat apples". You might notice that there is neither
                    a subject or object marker in this sentence. By context and using common sense we can assume that
                    the apple is not eating anything and that the person speaking eats apples.
                </p>
                <p>One thing we should warn you about—ㄹ/을것이다 is that it is not used when making assertions about your
                    own behavior.
                    It
                    makes sense if you think about it too, becuase ㄹ/을것이다 form is essentially a strong prediction and
                    you usually dont make predictions on things you will do, rather you know fairly well wether you will
                    actually do something or not.
                    ㄹ/을게요, a
                    slightly different form, is used as positive assertion of one’s intention. For example, when someone
                    asks you to do something we do not say "할거예요" because it implies uncertainty of wether we will
                    actually do it or not and is therefore rude. Instead, we respond by saying "할게요!" which implies
                    strong intention to do that thing. 'It is not known how this
                    form
                    evolved, but you can see that it’s similar to the ㄹ/을것이다 form. (It’s worth noting that Koreans
                    sometimes
                    spell the ㄹ/을게요 form as ㄹ/을께요 since it is usually pronounced with a strong ㄲ type sound, however the
                    correct spelling is ㄹ/을게요)
                </p>
                <p>“제가 재영씨(를) 믿을게요". (Obejct marker is unnecessary mainly because the subject marker is already present)</p>
