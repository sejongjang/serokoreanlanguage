            <p>Just right: Finally you’ve got this 요-form which is in the middle of these two. It’s not too hot and not
                too cold, but just right. The 요-form is usually the one you use when you meet Koreans for the first
                time. It’s good for all sorts of interpersonal situations, and is very well used in regular day-to-day
                life. Most importantly, you’re unlikely to offend or alienate someone by using this 요-form so that’s
                what we’ll be learning first
            </p>

            <p>
                If you’re wondering, it is essential to learn both of the other forms as well, they just aren’t our
                focus in the beginning. If the whole system seems a little bit complicated don’t worry about it, you’ll
                adjust in no time. Now I’ll distill what we’ve just discussed into just seven words. Use 요-form and you
                won’t offend anyone. Easy enough right?
