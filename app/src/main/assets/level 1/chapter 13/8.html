            <p>Great, now onto our last form, the “tentative” future tense. I know you’re wondering why Korean possibly
                needs two different kinds of future tense verbs, but in English we actually have words that express
                similar nuances. This tentative future tense is used in a few different ways, but the important thing to
                remember is that it always involves individual willpower. I’ll teach you the basics rights now, but
                we’ll learn more about it as we go along in upcoming chapters.
            </p>
            <p><b>General circumstances to use “겠다” include: 1- When responding to direct inquiries about your own
                    intention 2- When speaking formally 3- When expressing doubt 4- With 알다 / 모르다 5-When using
                    imperative-projection 해야겠어요</b>
            </p>
            <p>Without examples and explanation this is all meaningless, however the point is that the 겠다 future tense
                form is also important, and we’ll be going more in-depth as we progress more.</p>
