            </div>
            <p>Another thing to take note of is that 으 behaves a little bit strangely because it’s actually a neutral
                vowel. When 으 is all by itself, it acts like an 어-vowel. When we conjugate 끄다 it acts like an 어-vowel
                (in absence of any other vowels) and we add the harmonizing 어 glue to give us 끄어요. Here’s where things
                get weird. Since 으 is a neutral vowel it is absorbed into the 어 sound. The resulting verb is 꺼요, not 끄어요
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <p>But what happens when 으 is influenced by an 아-group vowel? Well as we saw above with verbs like 고르다 and
                잠그다,
                으 is also overruled by the 아-vowels. 고르다 becomes 골라요 and 잠그다 becomes 잠가요. So just remember that 으 has no
                personality of it’s own, and gets absorbed into whatever vowels are around it.
