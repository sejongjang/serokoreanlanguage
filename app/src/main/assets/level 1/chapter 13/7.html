            <p>Now on the future-tense front… The good news is that we won’t even be needing glue to conjugate future
                tense. The bad news? Korean has two future tense forms… Yes, let that sink in for a minute before I
                teach them to you. </p>
            <p>The first future tense form is the ㄹ/을 것이다 form. This form is primarily used when you make an assertion
                about something the future. You make this type of assertion when you have confidence in a certain
                outcome. For example, when your two friends have been dating for a while you might say, “they’re going
                to get married”. In these types of situations you would use ㄹ/을 것이다 form. So how do you actually use it?
                The key to this future tense form is the future tense modifier—ㄹ/을.
            </p>
            <p>ㄹ/을 is a very important piece of the grammar pie in Korean. It signifies something that will come to be.
                It’s hard to overstate how important this is or how much you’ll be using this modifier when you speak
                Korean. To change our verbs into their future-tense modifier form, we attach this ㄹ/을 thing sort of like
                a particle. Recall the steps from present tense conjugation:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <div class="center_context">
                <p><b>Step 1: Drop the 다</b></p>
                <p> 가다 → 가<br>
                    먹다 → 먹

                </p>
                <p><b>Step 2: With no 받침 add ㄹ, with 받침 add 을</b></p>
                <p>가 → 갈<br>
                    먹 → 먹을

                </p>
                <p><b>Step 3: Add 것이다 and conjugate it</b></p>
                <p>갈 → 갈것이에요<br>
                    먹을 → 먹을것이에요

                </p>

            </div>
            <p>This future tense is functionally a lot more simple than present and past tense. If you’re wondering what
                것 is, it’s an important noun meaning “thing”. 이다 is the copula that you’re so familiar with. If you
                literally translate this future tense form 갈것이에요 means essentially “Is a thing that will go”. A more
                natural translation is “Unspecified-subject will go.” I emphasized will because this is a pretty sure
                thing. It is going to happen. </p>
            <p>Korean being Korean, we can’t move on yet without mentioning how this future tense form contracts. With
                ㄹ/을 것이다, Koreans usually drop the 받침 off of “것”, leaving us with “거”. That allows us to drop out an
                additional block since we don’t need a vowel sound to offset the 받침. The result? “갈거예요”. In modern
                Korean this shortened version of the future tense is more common and comfortable than the full “갈것이에요”.
