            <p>Before we talk about past tense I’ll mention the abbreviation step, since we’ve already talked about the
                glue part. Contractions are used frequently in Korean, partially due to the nature of 한글. In cases where
                there’s little difference in pronunciation the writing is often made shorter for convenience. Over time
                these short forms have become the accepted convention for spelling. Verbs that have no 받침 are usually
                abbreviated. There are some incompatible vowel-combinations that do prevent combination, like in the
                case of 쉬다. Even though 쉬 and 어 do harmonize, 어 cannot be combined with 쉬 since 쉬 is already a compound
                vowel.</p>
            <p>You'll get used to how glue and contractions work quickly. It’s very logical and natural, especially once
                you start actually speaking the language a lot. At that point all this nonsense about spelling and
                conjugation fades away and you just feel how things work. I’ll give you three easy guidelines for using
                contractions with verbs here.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <p>But what happens when 으 is influenced by an 아-group vowel? Well as we saw above with verbs like 고르다 and
                잠그다,
                으 is also overruled by the 아-vowels. 고르다 becomes 골라요 and 잠그다 becomes 잠가요. So just remember that 으 has no
                personality of it’s own, and gets absorbed into whatever vowels are around it.
