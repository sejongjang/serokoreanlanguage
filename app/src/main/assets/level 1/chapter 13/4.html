            </div>
            <p>Before we talk about past tense I’ll mention the contraction step, since we’ve already talked about the
                glue part. <b><i>Contractions are used frequently in Korean</i></b>, partially due to the nature of 한글. In cases where
                there’s little difference in pronunciation the writing is often made shorter for convenience. Over time
                these short forms have become the accepted convention for spelling. Verbs that have no 받침 are usually
                abbreviated. There are some incompatible vowel-combinations that do prevent combination, like in the
                case of 쉬다. Even though 쉬 and 어 do harmonize, 어 cannot be combined with 쉬 since 쉬 is already a compound
                vowel.</p>
            <p>You'll get used to how glue and contractions work quickly. It’s very logical and natural, especially once
                you start actually speaking the language a lot. At that point all this nonsense about spelling and
                conjugation fades away and you just feel how things work. I’ll give you three easy guidelines for using
                contractions with verbs here.</p>

            <!--MATT**make a diagram with a circle around the 받침 before the 다 in verbs like 먹다, and 만들다-->
            <p>Don’t worry about contracting verbs that have a 받침 on the end of the verb stem (like 깎다 or 만들다).
