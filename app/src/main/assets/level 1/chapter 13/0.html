                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Welcome, welcome. I hope you enjoyed that second chapter about numbers. Please settle down somewhere
                    cozy and quiet so you can focus on one of the most important chapter in all of Sero Korean. Here we
                    will begin to harness the power of Korean verbs. This chapter we’re going to be learning past,
                    present, and future conjugations for the 요-polite ending we’ve already been using. </i></p>

        </div>

        <div class="mstandardpara">

            <p>Once you get into the mechanics of verb conjugation, it can get quite messy in many languages. With
                Korean, the traditional methods of teaching verb conjugation would definitely stray into that messy
                territory, but lucky for us there’s a better method. This method is excellent because it teaches the
                underlying logic behind what happens when verbs are conjugated. Again, this is much more simple and
                effective than trying to force your brain to remember what happens with every type of verb and
                verb-ending.

            </p>
            <p><b>In Korean there are three basic ways we can use verbs:</b>
                <br><b>1)</b> In base (infinitive) form as in 먹<u>다</u>
                <br><b>2)</b> With a connector (like glue) as in "먹<u>어</u>"
                <br><b>3)</b> With a conjugated ending as in "먹<u>어요</u>"
            </p>

            <p>The base form of Korean verbs is useful in many instances but not nearly as useful as a verb with a
                connector and/or ending. Connectors are especially useful because many of them can stand alone with no
                ending. Of course, they can also be used to connect to endings. There are also some endings that do not
                require connectors. </p>

                <p><b><i>새로 팀</i></b><br>Glue is not our creation. It was invented by the excellent teachers at the
                    Missionary Training Center (MTC) for the LDS Church in Provo, Utah. All credit goes to the original
                    creators. In the MTC, missionaries are trained for about two months before being sent off to share
                    their beliefs in Korea (and many other countries). The teachers in the MTC needed an effective
                    method to get the missionaries conjugating verbs correctly in a very short amount of time so this is
                    the system they came up with. The Glue method is being shared here with permission.

                Glue is the most important connecter because it is used for the most important ending—요. Well then, whithout further ado let's get started learning glue shall we?
