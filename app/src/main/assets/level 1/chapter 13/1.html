                    <b>살</b><br>

            <p>The next step is to apply glue to the verb stem, but how do we know what glue to apply? Well it turns out
                there are exactly two varieties of glue in Korean. “아-glue” and “어-glue”. Let’s discuss how we
                distinguish between the two.
            </p>
            <p> <b><i>Glue is based off of a concept known as “Vowel Harmony”.</i></b> Vowel harmony is not really
                present in English,
                so it is an unusual concept at first. Vowel harmony means that certain vowel sounds are often paired
                with other, “harmonizing” vowel sounds in the same word. Watch what happens when we conjugate 살다 and
                먹다to present tense, polite form.</p>
            <div class="center_context">
                <p><b>살다 → 살아요<br>
                        먹다 → 먹어요</b></p>
            </div>
            <p>Hmm... isn’t that interesting. The 아-glue is attached to 살, and the 어-glue is attached to 먹. What’s this
                all about? Well it turns out that all vowels in Korean fall into one of the two groups—the 아 group and
                the 어 group.
            </p>
            <p>Naturally 아 and 어 harmonize with themselves, as in the example above, but the other vowels also fall into
                one of the two groups. Check out some of these examples, starting with the 아 group.
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">
                <p><b>가다 → 가아요 → 가요<br>
                        깎다 → 깎아요 <br>
                        오다 → 오아요 → 와요<br>
                        볶다 → 볶아요 <br>

            </div>
            <p>Are you starting to see a pattern? Let’s look at the 어 group now.</p>
            <div class="center_context">
                    <p><b>가르치다 → 가르치어요 → 가르쳐요<br>

                </div>
            <div>
                <p>Well, this glue business isn’t so bad after all. I hope that’s what you’re thinking because it really
                    isn’t bad at all. <b><i>After dropping the “다” we apply glue by determining which vowel harmonizes
                            with
                            the last vowel in the verb stem.</i></b> Take the verb 가르치다, as seen above. If we drop the 다
                    we get the verb
                    stem, “가르치”. Then we look at the last vowel, “이” in this case, and determine if it’s an 아-vowel or
                    an 어-vowel.</p>

                <p><b><i>매튜 선생</i></b><br>The first time I went to McDonalds in Korea with my Korean friends I
                    thought I’d finally have the upper hand because surely my culture would reign supreme when it came
                    to eating McDonalds. Boy was I wrong. After walking in and stumbling through my order everything
                    seemed to be going normally. Soon our food came out and we headed over to a table. It was then that
                    I watched in horror as the Koreans cleared off a tray in the middle of the table and all dumped
                    their fries into one big pile in the middle. This despite the fact that some people got large and
                    some people got regular-size combos. Wanting desperately to be Koreanized, and not wanting to look
                    like some kind of American miser I too reluctantly dumped my fries in the middle. It was in that
                    moment I realized why North Korea hasn’t yet collapsed. Just kidding, but really there’s nothing
                    that highlights cultural differences like seeing your own countries traditions being… reinterpreted
                    under the context of a different culture.</p>
