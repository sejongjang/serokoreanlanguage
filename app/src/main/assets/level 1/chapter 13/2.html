                <p>Now here’s the really brilliant part about 한글, and this glue system. Check out this
                            chart.</p>

                        <p>The upper-right portion of the chart(ㅗ,ㅏ) is described as the positive vowels that are
                            conjugated to ㅏ when glue is used. The bottom left portion(ㅓ,ㅜ,ㅡ,ㅣ,etc.) is the negative
                            section that conjugates to ㅓ with glue.</p>

            <p>What this chart shows us is that if we think about Korean vowels visually, we can actually see whether
                they harmonize with 아 or with 어. So 애, being based on 아, is naturally an 아 verb, and 에 is an 어 vowel
                since it’s based on 어. Vowels that have an 오 or an 아 in them all harmonize with 아 (like 애, 얘, and 와).
                The one exception to this rule is 외 (the 이 overrules the 오 in this case). Vowels that have an 어, 우, 에,
                으, or 이 in them all harmonize with 어, with no exceptions.
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">
                <p>Here’s another chart that includes all of the compound vowels and Y-vowels.

            <!--Matt! add in chart/table   고맙쓰-->
            <p>Back when you were first learning the 한글 vowels it wouldn’t have done any good to explain this, but now
                we can see that with the exception of 외, <b>non-harmonizing vowels cannot be combined to form a compound.</b>
                It’s really very clean and logical once you see it like this. In fact the main concern now becomes
                understanding when we can combine, or abbreviate blocks, like with 가아요 becoming 가요.
