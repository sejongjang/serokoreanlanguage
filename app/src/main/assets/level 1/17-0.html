                <p>If we were to make a list of the most fundamental and crucial particles in Korean, 에 would definitely
                    be
                    in the top five on the list. This is because 에 wields the power to define targets, pinpoint times,
                    specify locations and point out directions. If there were no particle to fill this function you
                    would
                    never be able to answer the questions “where” or “when”. 에 is going to become one of our well used
                    and
                    trusty tools as we progress through learning Korean.

                    <p>“I’m going <b>to</b> the supermarket.” <br>
                        “You are eating dinner <b>at</b> 7?”<br>
                        “The game will be <b>in</b> the new stadium.”<br>
                        “The dog jumped <b>on</b> the table.”<br>

                <p>Ever wondered what’s so hard about English? Here’s one perfect example. Do you think you could
                    explain to
                    someone who’s not a native English speaker why we use these preposition words the way we do?
                    Essentially
                    to, at, in, and on all have the same fundamental function of pointing but are used in different
                    situations. Korean proves that these differences are negligible because 에 can be used in all four of
                    the
                    above example sentences.
