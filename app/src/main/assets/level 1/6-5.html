            <p>This next one is fun. This is the word for “Hello” when you answer the phone. Apparently it derives from
                “여기 보세요" or “Look here”. It’s completely nonsensical because if you are talking on the phone you likely
                can’t see the person you’re speaking with. Nevertheless it’s the thing to say upon answering phone
                calls.</p>
            <p>This is also a good time to tell you that there’s no single word for “goodbye” on the telephone. In
                fact, Koreans will often hang up rather abruptly as soon as they feel the reason for the phone call has
                been fully addressed. Just be careful not to hang up too quickly on someone who is older or in a
                position of leadership over you as it can be considered rude. It’s polite to stay on the line until the
                person who ranks higher socially hangs up first.</p>
