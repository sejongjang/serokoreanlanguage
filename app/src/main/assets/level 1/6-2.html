            <p>This next expression is an interesting one. It has a lot of variations, but 잘 지내세요 is a neutral and
                polite way to ask. "잘" is a word you’ll become intimately familiar with. It is an adverb and means
                good/well, skillfully, or
                frequently. Needless to say, this is a very <i>well</i>-used word in Korean.</p>
            <p>"지내세요" comes from the verb 지내다. This word means essentially “to pass”. It can be used literally like
                “to pass by the building” or figuratively like “to pass time”. This expression actually translates very
                nicely to the British way of asking—"Are you getting along well?"</p>
            <p>One quick note before the next phrase—we know it’s painful to go into detail about every new word we
                teach, but Korean has such different roots and usage that at least initially we don’t want you
                making assumptions about the words you learn. We told you 지내다 means to pass, but that doesn’t mean you
                can use it to say “pass the ball”, or “pass a kidney stone”. There are different verbs that cover those
                situations. So for now take what you learn in the context you learn it.</p>
            <p>That’s not to say you shouldn’t experiment making new sentences with the words we teach you. Just
                consider this as a
                forewarning that Korean words are not exact equivalents of what they translate to in English.
                That’s why translation is such messy business, and why it’s always better to understand things in the
                original language.</p>
