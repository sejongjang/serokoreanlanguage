                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>If you've ever wished there was a better way to
                        learn a language then you've come to the right place. Before getting starting we have a brief
                        introduction about the program that should be just the right thing to get you excited about
                        learning Korean.</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="mstandardpara">
                <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>elcome to Sero Korean. We’ve designed
                    this program to provide a smooth and comprehensive introduction
                    to the Korean language, including reading, writing, listening, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Sound like
                    a
                    lot to swallow? Well languages have a lot going on under the hood and only something truly
                    comprehensive can help you become fully functional in a new language. While some websites or
                    programs
                    make grand promises and assure you that little study time is required, we know that consistently
                    studying a broad-ranging curriculum in your target language is the real key to success. And we just
                    so
                    happen to have created such a curriculum.</p>
                <p>We’ve also included vital information about Korean culture and history. This information is included
                    in
                    separate cultural chapters that will keep things fresh and interesting while still teaching
                    vocabulary.
                    Integrating this all into one course allows us to provide you with a truly powerful and fun language
                    learning tool! </p>
                <p>When you first start learning any new language it can feel like you’re drinking from a fire hose and
                    that what you are learning isn’t sticking. With Sero Korean, we promise that we’ve done our best to
                    bring down the water pressure and help you drink it all in. If you’re thirsty to learn then let’s
                    get
                    started!</p>
