            <p><i>Along with our adventures learning Korean grammar, pronunciation, spelling, and what-have-you, we’ll
                    also be taking some breathers here and there to help you refresh your mind and give you time to
                    absorb what you’ve learned so far. These culture chapters will also serve the secret purpose of
                    making you better at Korean. “What? How can that be?” Well it turns out that knowing how to talk to
                    Koreans doesn’t do you much good if you don’t know what to talk to them about. Like I said,
                    language, culture, and history are inseparably intertwined. We’ll have you not just talking like,
                    but also thinking like a Korean in no time.</i></p>

            <p>For our first little segment I’ve elected to talk about one of the main reasons this app
                exists
                and
                the reason many people become interested in learning Korean. That reason is 한류(韓流),
                known
                in
                English as “The Korean Wave”.</p>
            <p>What is the Korean Wave? Put simply, it’s a revolution in the entertainment industry that is
                taking
                the
                world by storm. Starting about ten years ago (with roots going back much further), Korean
                movies,
                music, and television began gaining serious international recognition. Since then the
                Korean
                Wave
                has
                only gotten bigger and gained more momentum.</p>
            <p>In a world dominated by Hollywood, many people have found Korean storytelling techniques to
                be
                refreshing. The stories are character-driven and uplifting. Korean directors rely less on
                splashy
                special effects and more on impressively talented and good-looking actors and actresses,
                coupled
                with hearty writing. If you’ve never watched a Korean drama I highly recommend trying one
                out.
                I’ll just
                warn you that they can be extremely addictive!</p>
