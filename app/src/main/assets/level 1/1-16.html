                <p>Alright! You made it through all the main letters in Korean. Not too bad right? On the last page of
                    every chapter we will have an extremely consice review/wrapup section. This is to help you pass the
                    quiz(s) at the end of each chapter. By deafult you must pass the quiz before moving on to the next
                    level, however this feature can be toggled off in the settings.</p>
                <p>As for what you learned this chapter, I’m sure you’re beginning to
                    see the patterns and how the letters in Hangul build on each other. If you can’t remember a letter,
                    make your
                    mouth into the shape it prescribes. <b>Remember that Hangul letters actually look like their
                        sound!</b>
                    You may be skeptical, but we promise it works and it will help you remember the letters. Next
                    chapter
                    we’ll
                    be talking about the vowel sounds, which are fairly straightforward.</p>

                <!-- Author Note-->
                <div id="myAuthornote" class="authornote" onclick="closeNav()">
                    <p>One other thing you’ll notice is that
                        there are a few consonants from English which are conspicuously missing from Korean. We
                        mentioned
                        that there is no "th" sound in Korean, but if you’ve been
                        keeping score at home you’ll have realized that "F”, “TH” “V”, and “Z” are all nowhere to be
                        found.
                        (Rough approximations of “Q” and “X” can technically be reproduced in Korean. R and L are also
                        debatably present.)</p>
                    <p><b>These missing sounds simply don’t
                            exist in Modern Hangul.</b> Anciently
                        Hangul also had the letters ㅸ,ㆄ, ㅹ, ㅱ, ᅎ, ᅔ, ᅏ, ᅐ, ᅕ, ᅑ, ᄼ, ᄽ, ᄾ, ᄿ, ㆁ, ㆆ, ㆅ, and ㅿ which
                        corresponded to various sounds like "Th" and "Z" while some are just ancient variations of ㅈ and ㅅ.
                        However, for simplicity’s sake, over time they narrowed down hangul into the alphabetic set you
                        see today.</p>
                    <p>Instead you’ve got a new sort of sound in
                        ㄹ and some more fun new sounds we’ll be talking about in the next two chapters. Be careful
                        not to
                        mix in English sounds that aren’t a part of the Korean language. You'll find this especially
                        difficult when it comes to "Konglish", or English vocabulary imported into the Korean
                        language.
                        Words like
                        “fitness” and “theme’ are scrubbed clean of sounds absent in Korean and come out as what can
                        best
                        be described as creative
                        approximation of the original English word.</p>
                    <p>This presents a challenge because you essentially have
                        to learn a new system of pronunciation for words you already know, and Koreans love to drop
                        some
                        English words into their
                        sentences to add a little bit of... <i>panache</i> to their dialogue (see what I did there).
                    </p>
                    <p>This no doubt has something to do with Hangul being created long after the spoken-language was
                        already
                        well established. King Sejong actually made a system that was more powerful and flexible than the
                        language itself needed. Pretty impressive.</p>

                        <li>Hangul is made of blocks of letters, and each "block" should be pronounced as one syllable.
                        </li>
                        <li>In each block, the Hangul letters should be written as if you are trying to fill up an
                            imaginary square.</li>
                        <li>Letters on the bottom of blocks are called “badchim” (받침)</li>
                        <li>The t-stop badchim letter are ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, and ㅌ </li>
                        <li>Compound badchim are ㄺ, ㄳ, ㄻ, ㄽ, ㅄ, ㄶ, ㄵ, ㄼ, ㅀ, ㄾ (ㄿ and ㄽ are rare).</li>
                        <li>Korean sounds tend to be more throaty (with the exception of aspirated consonants).</li>
