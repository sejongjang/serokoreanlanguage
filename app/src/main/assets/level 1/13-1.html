            <p>Recall that all Korean verbs and adjectives end in "다". Well it turns out that <b>the very first step to
                    take when conjugating a Korean verb is to drop the "다".</b> Dropping the "다" will give you the verb
                stem form.

            <p>The next step is to apply glue to the verb stem, but how do we know what glue to apply? Well it turns
                out
                there are exactly two varieties of glue in Korean. “아-glue” and “어-glue”. Let’s discuss how we
                distinguish between the two.
            </p>
            <p><b>Glue is based off of a concept known as “Vowel Harmony”.</b> Vowel harmony is not really
                present in English,
                so it is an unusual concept at first. Vowel harmony means that certain vowel sounds are often paired
                with other, “harmonizing” vowel sounds in the same word. Watch what happens when we conjugate 살다 and
                먹다to present tense, polite form.</p>

                    <h4>살다 → 살아요</h4>

            </div>
            <p>The 아-glue is attached to 살, and the 어-glue is attached to 먹. What’s
                this
                all about? Well it turns out that all vowels in Korean fall into one of the two groups—the 아 group
                and
                the 어 group.
            </p>
            <p>Naturally 아 and 어 harmonize with themselves, as in the example above, but the other vowels also fall
                into
                one of the two groups. Check out some of these examples, starting with the 아 group.

            <p> Well, this glue business isn’t so bad after all. I hope that’s what
                you’re thinking because it really
                isn’t bad. <b>After dropping the “다” we apply glue by determining which vowel
                    harmonizes
                    with
                    the last vowel in the verb stem.</b> Take the verb 가르치다, as seen above. If we drop
                the 다
                we get the verb
                stem, “가르치”. Then we look at the last vowel, “이” in this case, and determine if it’s an 아-vowel
                or
                an 어-vowel.</p>

            <p><i>*Note that 부르다 (to call out/yell/sing) is considered an exception verb
                    because an extra ㄹ is added
                    into the verb during glue conjugation. It's not really a special exception however because there are
                    at least 50 other verbs ending in "르다" that also have the extra ㄹ added during conjugation. Among
                    these "exceptions" are some of the most common verbs in Korean, including "모르다" (to not know), "바르다"
                    (to apply/put on), "오르다" (to go up), and "자르다" (to cut).</i></p>
