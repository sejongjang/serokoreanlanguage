            <p>Before wrapping up this chapter a word on appliances, Koreans don’t use the 전자 레인지 (microwave) as often
                as Westerners do, but most homes do have them. They also don’t use the 오븐 (oven) as much, but it is
                gaining popularity. They prefer 가스 레인지 (gas stoves) and they like to do dishes by hand. Dishwashing
                machines
                are almost unheard of in Korea (though I suspect there will be a market for those too in the future).
                Along with dishwashers, dryers are extremely rare. You will almost certainly find a 세탁기 (washer) in
                every
                Korean home, however. </p>
            <p>If this is sounding a little barbaric to you then just wait because Koreans make up for their missing
                appliances by using appliances that are rare or non-existent in the West. One of those is a special
                kind of refrigerator known as the 김치 냉장고 (kimchi refrigerator). Kimchi has to be kept cold for long
                periods of time (even months) and these refrigerators are specially designed to help fresh food last.
                They also work better than normal refrigerators at keeping things like fruit and vegetables fresh
                longer.
            </p>
            <p>Another appliance Koreans like to use is the 제습기 (dehumidifier). Korea is so humid in the summer that it
                can often seem unbearably hot and sweaty. This machine coupled with the air conditioner can help you
                feel
                more fresh. </p>
            <p>Another very common appliance in Korea is the 공기 청정기 (air purifier). This is a great thing to have
                around since Korean does have a fair amount of air pollution depending on various factors like the
                time of year (a good amount of the pollution is attributable to China).
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Koreans love to have hot and cold water on demand at any time. This has led to the extreme
                popularity of the 정수기 (purified water dispenser). These machines are hooked up to a source of water
                and then they filter the water. There is a reservoir of water that is cooled and a reservoir of water
                that is kept piping hot. You can tap a button to select the kind of water you want and then put your
                cup under the spout to fill it up. This is extremely convenient for a country that likes all kinds of
                tea and instant coffee, as well as cold water.</p>
            <p>Samsung and LG, two of Korea’s technology giants, are always on the lookout for new appliance
                marketplaces.
                Lately there’s also been some fun inventions like steamer closets to get wrinkles out of your clothes.
