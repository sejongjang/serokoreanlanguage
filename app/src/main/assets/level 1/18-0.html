                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>So far we’ve primarily been learning about how to
                        make statements and confirm those statements. Things
                        like, “This is a chair”, “Jaeyoung went to the store?”, and “It wasn’t me”. While statements are
                        important, they aren’t as powerful as questions are. Now we will learn how to make real
                        questions
                        using question words. Questions open the world to discovery and will open up your Korean
                        speaking
                        abilities dramatically.</i></p>

                <p>You’ve heard of the five “W's” in English right? The words that we ask questions with—who, what,
                    where,
                    why, and when. Besides these five there is the word “how”. Interestingly Korean has a similar
                    feature to
                    English in regards to question words. Like English has the five W’s, Korean has the 7 어’s:

                <p>These together are effectively the big 11 question words. It shouldn’t be hard to memorize them
                    because
                    we’ll be seeing them a lot. Wait, but two of these mean almost the same thing! I know I can hear
                    your
                    protests. The words 어떤 and 무슨 translate to “what type” and “what kind” respectively. Just because
                    the
                    definition is similar doesn’t mean they are interchangable, however. To understand when to use them
                    let’s look at their origins.
                </p>
                <p>어떤 comes from an interesting root word—the interrogative verb 어떻다, meaning “to be how”. Interrogative
                    verbs are not a common linguistic feature, but Korean is a special language. You'll also notice that
                    the
                    word for “how”, “어떻게”is also based on the same verb, 어떻다.
                </p>

                <p>None of the other nine interrogative words here are based off a verb. To understand the difference
                    between 어떤 and 무슨 first recognize that for us to use 어떤, the thing we are asking about has to be
                    “how”—i.e. it must be describable, and it must have some qualities that can be associated with it.
                    That
                    means that 어떤 is typically used when you are asking about one specific noun out of a set of
                    preexisting
                    nouns. That means that at times it's also used similarly to the word 어느. I'll give you some
                    examples.
                </p>
                <!--add figure-->
                <p>On the other hand 무슨 tends to be a little more abstract.</p>
                <!--add figure-->
                <p>Unfortunately, there is some crossover between the two words—situations where both words work. You'll
                    quickly get a feel for when to use which word though, so don't worry too much. </p>
