                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Before tackling Chinese numbers we'll switch gears for a couple of chatpers and give you a breather.
                    This chapter we’ll be tackling a new
                    particle—the topic marker. The topic marker is a little bit like the subject marker (이/가) that we
                    already learned in chapter 7. It's fascinating though because 은/는 is a piece of grammar that has no
                    direct equivalent in English.</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <p> 은/는 is what we use to mark the topic of a sentence (or paragraph). The
                은/는 particle behaves like the other particle that we’ve already learned (이/가), meaning that it sticks
                onto the end of nouns and dictates what role that noun has in the sentence. 은/는 comes after nouns,
                often at the beginning of the sentence.</p>
            <p>Now after learning that 이/가 marks the <u>subject</u>—and that there is a separate particle, 은/는, that
                marks
                the <u>topic</u>—the typical response usually goes something like this: <i>“So what’s the difference
                between a
                topic and a subject?”</i> This is a question that has plagued Korean learners for eons. I suppose
                if you
                think about it in terms of English there is very little difference between the topic of a sentence and
                the subject of a sentence. In that regard, part of the confusion between these two particles might
                arise from being poorly named. “Topic marker” doesn’t really capture everything that’s going on with
                은/는. Despite that, calling 은/는 the topic marker does correctly indicate that the sentence <i>is about</i>
                whatever is marked by the topic marker. The subject marker, on the other hand, merely indicates that
                the subject of the sentence is what is doing the. “verbing”.</p>
            <p>Let's see if we can demonstrate this a little bit with some English sentences before we dive into the
                Korean. In the sentence “John eats apples.” John is the subject. John is the one eating the apples. In
                this case we can also assume with some confidence that the topic is also John. Hence the subject and
                the topic are one and the same.</p>
            <p>Now let’s look at another example. “Writing poems is the hardest thing.” In this case we get that
                ‘writing poems’ is the subject of the sentence, but the overall topic is less clear. We may be talking
                about English class, or how good a certain poet is, or we may actually be talking about 'poem
                writing'. In English the topic is
                usually established using the subject, but in this case it’s not clear that the subject and the topic
                are the same. Thankfully there is a way we can write a topic into this sentence without changing the
                subject. This will also help us understand how Korean works.</p>

            <div class="sentence-container">
                <div class="sentence-main-item">
                    <h4><u>As for</u> English class, writing poems is the most difficult.</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, ‘writing’ is still maintained as the subject (the thing interacting with the verb), but
                this sentence is not about ‘writing’. This sentence is instead meant to advance the topic of the
                conversation—English class.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned before, grammatical roles in English are not strictly defined like they are in Korean.
                Things happen behind the scenes, and we don’t have to think about whether the word we are using is
                acting as the topic or the subject (or both as the case may be) and can just speak it. In Korean
                however, it is necessary to put the correct marker on our nouns. This applies whether in speaking or
                writing. While this may seem cumbersome at first, you’ll soon see how Korean allows for succinct,
                fine-tuned control over the nuance of a sentence with the 은/는 and 이/가 particles.</p>
