            <p>Finally, the Korean landscape is very rugged. This means that it’s difficult to have large, cultivated
                fields. Instead, things that grow naturally or things that don’t require a lot of space to grow, are
                emphasized. The large population of the Korean peninsula squeezes the already limited arable land, so
                you can literally see miniature farms all over the place. This nod to ancient Korean society is a sight
                to be seen amidst towering apartment buildings and the modern bustling streets. In these “farms” are
                things like carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cabbage, peppers, squash, tomatoes, onions, and garlic.
            </p>
            <p>Although much of the food sold in supermarkets is likely to be imported, Korea still has a thriving
                street market culture. Go there and you’ll find grandmothers sitting on cardboard on the street corner,
                selling their fresh-picked, organically-grown garlic for half the price of the grocery store. These
                street markets are hard to miss and are definitely worth checking out whenever you make it to Korea. You
                may have to do some haggling to get the desired price, but haggling is another great way to improve your
                Korean!
            </p>
            <p>Another thing to keep in mind with Korean food is that, historically, wheat and dairy are not really part
                of the Korean diet. This is stunning since those are essentially the two most important staples of the
                western diet. What do they have instead? The answer is rice and tea. </p>
