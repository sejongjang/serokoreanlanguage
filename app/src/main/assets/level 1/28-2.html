            <p>Too hot: Informal, impolite speech— characterized primarily by 야, 냐, 아, and 어 endings. Koreans call this
                way of speaking “반말" (literally meaning “half-speech). Using 반말 implies that you feel close to whomever
                you’re talking with, which sounds great right? I can pull out some 반말 and make friends with people in no
                time. Wrong. You aren’t going to make any friends by speaking 반말 to a stranger. At best you’d merit some
                annoyed glares and irked responses.


            </p>

            <p>
                Along with being used among those who have close relationships, 반말 is also used among people who are the
                same age. Remember I said age is important? Interestingly the Korean word for friend, 친구, exclusively
                applies to those born in the same year as you. In Korea you cannot be “friends” with someone who’s not
                your same age. That’s not to say that you can’t have close relationships with those non-friends, but
                there are different words you use besides 친구.


            </p>
            <p>반말 is also used under certain circumstances to speak to those who are social rank than you, but not the
                first time you meet them. Until you have clearly established your societal standing with each other it’s
                polite to use 요-form, even if you’re talking to kids in school uniforms. Typically the only
                circumstances where you can get away with speaking 반말 right away are with very young children or when
                talking to pets, like dogs or cats (it’s a very strange feeling to see dogs respond to commands in
                Korean and not in English). Of course you’re likely to run into some elderly people who speak 반말 to you
                right away, but that’s generally accepted as well.
