                <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n Chapter 1 we talked
                    about regular consonants and aspirated consonants. There are five regular consonants (ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅇ,
                    and
                    ㅈ) which have aspirated versions (ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, and ㅎ). You remember that aspirated letters have
                    another
                    line
                    added, but it turns out that four of these letters (ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, and ㅈ) as well as another consonant (ㅅ)
                    all
                    have a "tensed" version. These tensed-cosonants are made by doubling the letter. The first one we'll
                    look at is ㄲ.</p>

                <!-- Small Grid -->
                <div class="grid-container">
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h3><audio src="../audio/gga.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound(this)">까</a>

                    </div>
                </div>


                <p>These tensed-consonants are a little bit stronger than the regular ones. Give it a listen a listen
                    again
                    and compare it with 가.</p>

                <!-- Small Grid -->
                <div class="grid-container">
                    <div class="grid-item">
                        <h3><audio src="../audio/ga.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound(this)">가</a>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>You can feel it right? There’s something to these tensed consonants that isn’t there in non-tensed
                    ones.
                    There are two problems you’ll encounter here, however. First, on the listening front you may be able
                    to
                    hear the difference when it’s clearly enunciated for you like this, but Koreans talk fast. You have
                    to
                    be able to distinguish tensation in regular conversation, which is much more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>Secondly, when it comes to pronouncing these tensed consonants, foreigners tend to just say the
                    original
                    consonant but louder. Please take this to heart now, because it can save you from embarrassment
                    later.
                    <b>Tensed consonants are not pronounced by saying them louder than their regular counterparts.</b>
                    But
                    if they’re not
                    louder, what’s different about them? </p>
                <p>Listen below and then let's talk some more.</p>

                <p>Essentially there are two distinguishing factors between regular consonants and tensed ones. The
                    first
                    thing is that tensed consonants start a little higher than normal. While Korean gratefully has no
                    system of tones like Thai or Chinese do, one thing about these double consonants is that they do
                    have a
                    sort of falling tone to them. Again, listen carefully and try to replicate.</p>


                <!-- Author Note-->
                <div id="myAuthornote" class="authornote" onclick="closeNav()">
                    <p><i>When I got to Korea and began
                            speaking with many people I was able to start hearing the
                            difference between regular and tensed-consonants fairly quickly, but it took a couple of
                            years
                            and tons of practice to figure out exactly how to pronounce these tensed consonants in a way
                            that made it so Koreans knew which letter I was saying. It turns out that if I had just
                            known
                            about
                            these
                            two fairly easy guidelines I would have been able to ensure that Koreans knew whether I
                            mean 굴 or 꿀 from the beginning. You, lucky reader, get this information
                            without having to figure it out for yourself the hard way.</i></p>
                </div>
                <span id="opener" onclick="openNav()">
                    <div class="authorcard">
                        <div class="authorarrow" id="myArrowBox"><img src="../img/leftarrow.png" alt="left"
                                id="myArrow"></div>
                    </div>
                </span>
                <p>The other thing about tensed consonants is that they have a different timing to them than regular
                    letters do. It’s almost as if you take an ever so tiny pause right before you say the letter. This
                    adds
                    tension. It’s like pulling back just a little bit harder on a rubber band before launching it at
                    your
                    unsuspecting target. Since this tension builds up a little bit longer, the release is a little bit
                    more
                    dramatic. Again, this doesn’t really mean louder, just different.</p>
