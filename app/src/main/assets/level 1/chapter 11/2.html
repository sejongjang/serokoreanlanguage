            <p>You may be wondering what the difference between a waste bin and a trash can is. A waste bin is usually a
                smaller trash can used for waste items such as tissues, used floss, band-aids, etc. A trash can can be
                used for regular trash and larger waste items.</p>

            <p>Before eating dinner you can ask your friend if it’s alright to use the bathroom, “화장실 써도 될까요?”. Your
                friend will kindly point you in the direction of the 화장실 (bathroom). Upon approaching you’ll realize
                that
                Korean bathrooms are a little bit different from what you may be used to.
            </p>
            <p>The typical Korean home bathroom has a floor which is a few inches lower than the rest of house.
                There are two reasons for this. The first is that traditional Korean homes were often heated by
                hot smoke underneath the floor in an astonishing system known as 온돌 (don’t worry you don’t have to
                remember
                this word). 온돌 worked by having a series of ducts to conduct air under the floor. Koreans came to love
                having
                heated floors and the tradition has persisted today but has been replaced by the much safer and more
                effective
                method of piping hot water under the floors. This is typically how Korean homes are heated but requires
                the
                floor to be raised to make room for the piping. To save money this piping is not used where people
                aren’t
                likely to sit or walk or lie, such as the entryway and bathrooms, where the floor is lower.</p>

            <p>The other reason the floor is lower is to prevent water on the ground from escaping. Outside of the
                bathroom door
                you may find that there are 샌들 (flip-flops/sandals) there. This is to keep your feet from getting wet.
                Slip them
                on and step down into the bathroom. </p>

            <p>Once inside, you’ll notice that there is probably no shower curtain. This is because in Korea the entire
                bathroom
                is designed to get wet. In some cases, there will be no tub either, just a showerhead. When use the 샤워
                (shower)
                in a Korean bathroom feel free to spray water everywhere as it will all drain down a single drain on the
                bathroom
                floor. Of course it may take time for the bathroom to dry completely, hence the 샌들.</p>

            <p>If you use the 변기 (toilet) there’s a good chance it will have a 비데 (bidet). Feel free to use that
                feature.
                Unfortunately in some older-style Korean bathrooms there may be a 휴지통 (trash can) next to the toilet for
                throwing
                away used 휴지 (toilet paper). In the old days Korean buildings were not built with large, American-style
                pipes and
                plumbing. As a result, flushing toilet paper can result in clogs. If you encounter a bathroom like this
                throw the
                toilet paper in the trash, but more likely than not you’ll be just fine flushing everything down.
            </p>
            <p>After using the you 변기 wash your hands in the 싱크대 (sink). Replace the 샌들 where you found them and return 
                to the 거실 (living room) where you were earlier. If the food is not ready, your host may invite you to watch 
                some 텔레비전 (TV). You can control the TV with the 리모콘 (remote controller). You might also browse through the 
                책 (books) on the 책꽂이 (bookshelf) in the living room.
