            <p><i>Here’s a fun little chapter. You’ll pick up lots of useful vocabulary here and get to learn how daily
                    life functions for many Koreans. We’ll continue to try and break up the monotony of learning grammar
                    by teaching vocabulary and teaching about life and culture in Korea.

            <p>Once you arrive in Korea it won’t be long before you get invited into someone’s home. While Koreans tend
                to play outside of their house, they do like to invite close friends or family over for meals. Here’s
                some vocabulary to get us started.</p>
            <p>When you are first invited into someone’s home in Korea, you’ll probably be given an address. A quick
                search on Google or Naver Maps (a domestic Google competitor) will reveal the location and what public
                transport you need to take to get there. There’s a very high chance that the first house in Korea you
                visit will be an 아파트 (apartment). Individual Korean-style homes called 한옥 and Western-style homes called
                주택 do exist, they are just more expensive.</p>
            <p>The word 아파트 comes from the English word “apartment”. There is an ever-increasing number of
                English-import words in the Korean language (or at least the South Korean language). This is no doubt
                due to the Western influence that Korea has received a lot of in recent decades. These words are
                convenient for English speakers learning Korean, but it’s important to pronounce these “Konglish” words
                in the Korean way. Be warned that occasionally the me
                aning of English words is also changed when they
                are used in Korean.</p>
            <p>Now let’s look at another example. “Writing poems is the most difficult.” In this case we get that
                ‘poem writing’ is the subject of the sentence, but the overall topic is less clear. We may be talking
                about English class, or how much a certain poet sucks, or the topic may actually be 'poem
                writing'. In English the topic is
                usually established using the subject, but in this case it’s not clear that the subject and the topic
                are the same. Thankfully there is a way we can write a topic into this sentence without changing the
                subject. This will also help us understand how Korean works.</p>

            <!-- Example Sentence Grid -->
            <div class="sentence-container">
                <div class="sentence-main-item">
                    <h4><u>As for</u> English class, writing poems is the most difficult.</h4>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, ‘writing’ is still maintained as the subject (the thing interacting with the verb), but
                this sentence is not about ‘writing’. This sentence is instead meant to advance the topic of the
                conversation—English class.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned before, grammatical roles in English are not strictly defined like they are in Korean.
                Things happen behind the scenes, and we don’t have to think about whether the word we are using is
                acting as the topic or the subject (or both as the case may be) and can just speak it. In Korean
                however, it is necessary to put the correct marker on our nouns. This applies whether in speaking or
                writing. While this may seem cumbersome at first, you’ll soon see how Korean allows for succinct,
                fine-tuned control over the nuance of a sentence with the 은/는 and 이/가 particles.</p>
