                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Here’s a fun little chapter. You’ll pick up lots of useful vocabulary (like a lot) here and get to
                    learn how daily
                    life functions for many Koreans. We’ll continue to try and break up the monotony of learning grammar
                    by teaching vocabulary and teaching about life and culture in Korea.
                </i></p>
            <p>Once you arrive in Korea it won’t be long before you get invited into someone’s home. While Koreans tend
                to play outside of their house, they do like to invite close friends or family over for meals. Here’s
                some vocabulary to get us started.</p>

                <p>When you are first invited into someone’s home in
                    Korea, you’ll probably be given an address. A quick
                    search on Google or Naver Maps (a domestic Google competitor) will reveal the location and what
                    public
                    transport you need to take to get there. There’s a very high chance that the first house in Korea
                    you
                    visit will be an 아파트 (apartment). Individual Korean-style homes, called 한옥, and Western-style homes,
                    called
                    주택, do exist, they are just more expensive.</p>
                <p>The word 아파트 comes from the English word “apartment”. As we discussed last chapter there is an
                    ever-increasing number of
                    English-import words in the Korean language (or at least the South-Korean language). This is no
                    doubt
                    due to the Western influence that Korea has received a lot of in recent centuries, and especially in
                    recent decades. These words are
                    convenient for English speakers learning Korean, but it’s important to pronounce these “Konglish”
                    words
                    in the Korean way. Be warned that occasionally the meaning of English words is also changed when
                    they
                    are used in Korean.</p>

                <p>As I mentioned before, grammatical roles in English are not strictly defined like they are in Korean.
                    Things happen behind the scenes, and we don’t have to think about whether the word we are using is
                    acting as the topic or the subject (or both as the case may be) and can just speak it. In Korean
                    however, it is necessary to put the correct marker on our nouns. This applies whether in speaking or
                    writing. While this may seem cumbersome at first, you’ll soon see how Korean allows for succinct,
                    fine-tuned control over the nuance of a sentence with the 은/는 and 이/가 particles.</p>
