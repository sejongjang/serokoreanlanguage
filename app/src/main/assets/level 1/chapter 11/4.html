            <p>We won’t go further into counting things in this chapter, but another extremely important use for Korean
                numbers (as opposed to Chinese numbers) is counting age. These cardinal numbers we’ve been talking
                about are also necessary to tell someone how old you are. As we’ll be discussing more, age is rather
                important in Korean society and it’s usually one of the first things you find out about people you
                meet. You’ll also been fielding the question a lot. To prepare you for this, make sure you get the
                cardinal numbers down really well. To tell how old you are simply add the age counter “살". Here’s some
                examples.</p>

            <p>So you’re all set to tell your age now! Right? Well… not so fast. Hold onto your hat because I have
                another stunning revelation for you. Just like Korean has two number systems, there is also two ways of
                telling age. In the native-Korean system Koreans count age a different way than other countries do. <i>What?!
                    How can there possibly more than one way to count age?!</i> Funny right? Well it turns out that in
                Korea the year you were born is actually more important than the day you were born on. That means you
                don’t
                age on your birthday, but you actually become older on new year’s day, along with everyone else in the
                country. I guess it makes bearing the burden of becoming older easier when everyone else goes through
                the same thing as you. It does put a damper on the holiday though.</p>
            <p>A simple method for determining your age in Korea is to figure out how many years have passed between
                the year you were born and the current year, then add one to that number. Someone born in 1987 could
                subtract 1987 from 2017 (the year Sero Korean was written) and come up with 30. Then we add one and get
                31. Why 31 and not 30? Well that’s the other funny part—in Korea when you are born you are 1 year old,
                not 0 like in other countries. It makes sense when you think about it because you were in the womb for
                more than half of a year, so Koreans round up to age 1.</p>
            <p>As unimaginable as it may sound there are 2-year-old newborn infants in Korea. If you are born on
                December 31 you are 1 year old, and then the next day on January first you would turn 2. While it takes
                time to get adjusted to such an unique system, I’m sure you’ll get it in no time. It also helps that
                everyone who was born the same year as you are the same age. If you forget, just ask one of them. Live
                in Korea long enough and you’ll surprise yourself by forgetting your international age and remembering
                only your Korean age—believe me it’s a strange feeling. That’s one sign you’re being truly Koreanized.
            </p>
            <p>Koreans also occasionally use the international system of counting age (where you start out at age 0 and
                age on your birthday). This system is typically for legal/regulatory stuff. However if someone asks for
                your age when you meet them the first time be aware that they are asking about your <i>Korean</i> age.</p>
            <p>Remeber the phrase "성함이 어떻게 되세요?" that we can use to ask people's names? It turns out this same phrase
                works with the work "나이" meaning "age". Check it out.</p>
