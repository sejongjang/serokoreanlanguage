            <p>If you are lucky enough to be invited to sit on the ground and eat at a 상, it’s polite to cross your legs
                tightly in front of you to make enough room for others sitting around the table as well. If you find
                sitting
                criss-cross painful don’t worry, you’re not the only Westerner to have had trouble. Koreans will
                understand
                if it’s difficult and try to make room for you to sit in a more comfortable position.
            </p>
            <p>Before the meal begins it’s polite to wait for everyone to be seated and for the person with the highest
                social
                position to begin eating first before you dig in (you should also wait a for everyone to get their food
                at the
                restaurant before eating). Before taking your first bite you should say “잘 먹겠습니다!” or “I will enjoy this
                meal”.
                This isn’t just a nice thing to say, it’s customary and used virtually every time someone makes or buys
                you food.
                Like saying “happy birthday”, it’s just what you do.
            </p>
            <p> In the case of being served Korean food you will almost certainly find 젓가락 (chopsticks), 숟가락 (spoon),
                and a bowl of rice in front of yourself. If you don’t know how to use 젓가락 before going to Korea, you’ll
                learn in no time (sort of a sink or swim type thing). Fair warning though, Korean chopsticks are
                shorter,
                slender, and are often made of slippery metal. If you can master these you can use any other chopsticks
                in the world. You will use the chopsticks to dig into all the delicious 반찬 (side dishes). We’ll talk
                more
                about Korean food in Chapter 16, so look forward to it!</p>
            <p>In the off chance you aren’t being served Korean food you’ll likely find a 포크 (fork) and 나이프 in front of
                you as well.
                While chopsticks are actually a superior instrument for eating things like noodles, Koreans like to
                follow the
                Western tradition of eating with forks and knives when eating western food like pasta or steak.</p>
            <p>During the meal you’ll find that Koreans share food. And we don’t just mean they share food, we mean like
                they SHARE food.
                All kidding aside, Koreans all dish food out of the same trays/bowls using their own chopsticks. They
                even drink soup
                out of the same bowls with their own spoons. Of course, in a public place like a buffet-style restaurant
                this is
                forbidden and there are individual tongs or scoopers for each dish. Traditionally meal time is the way
                Koreans bond,
                and sharing the same dishes bonds you together.</p>
            <p>For those germaphobes among you that are no doubt panicking right now, just hear me out. You’ve been
                invited into your
                friend’s home and you’ve used their bathroom. That means you’ve probably already been exposed to
                whatever germs you were
                going to be exposed to. Additionally, Korea has a very high life expectancy.</p>

                <p><b><i>매튜 선생</i></b><br>The first time I went to McDonalds in Korea with my Korean friends I
                    thought I’d finally have the upper hand because surely my culture would reign supreme when it came
                    to eating McDonalds. Boy was I wrong. After walking in and stumbling through my order everything
                    seemed to be going normally. Soon our food came out and we headed over to a table. It was then that
                    I watched in horror as the Koreans cleared off a tray in the middle of the table and all dumped
                    their fries into one big pile in the middle. This despite the fact that some people got large and
                    some people got regular-size combos. Wanting desperately to be Koreanized, and not wanting to look
                    like some kind of American miser I too reluctantly dumped my fries in the middle. It was in that
                    moment I realized why North Korea hasn’t yet collapsed. Just kidding, but really there’s nothing
                    that highlights cultural differences like seeing your own countries traditions being… reinterpreted
                    under the context of a different culture.</p>

                </div>
            </span>
            <p style="margin-right:15px">Now if you are really close to your Korean friends don’t be surprised if they drink out of your cup or
                even feed you
                things with their own chopsticks. It’s gross if you think about it wrong, but in another sense it’s
                extremely endearing.
                Indeed, certain kinds of things that are typically only reserved for partners/lovers in the West are
                fair game among close friends in Korea.</p>
