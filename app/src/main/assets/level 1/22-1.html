            <p>Unlike English family names, Korean names did not develop as an identifier based on people’s occupations.
                Long before family names became standard in England, Koreans were using native Korean family names. Then
                along came that dastardly Chinese language and it started to mess things up. Eventually a Chinese
                character was adopted to write every family name, and during this time pronunciation for names changed
                too. Nowadays, there are even different characters used to write the same last name in some cases,
                depending on your branch of the family. For example, while all 김(Kim) family members write their last
                name with 金, there are three different characters(李, 異, 伊) used to write 이(Lee) depending on what branch
                of the family you are from.

            </p>
            <p>Another trend common in Asia is putting the “last name” first (to avoid confusion let’s call it the
                “family” name). Korean names always do this and they are usually followed by two syllable “first names”
                (which are of course second-names in Korea… sigh). Why don’t we look at some examples. The family names
                are bolded.</p>

            <p>You can see that five family names in Korea are so common that they constitute moreFragment than half the
                population.
