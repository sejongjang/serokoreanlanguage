            <p>Our next phrase is quite similar to the last one and is used frequently when you meet someone for the
                first time. It’s unusual however because it's hard to come up with an equivalent phrase in English. Any
                literal
                translation of this phrase is awkward. This expression might also be rendered as, “I
                hope we can work well together,” or “I look forward to getting to know you," or "Please take care of
                me".</p>
            <p>What’s going on here? Well we have the word 잘 that we learne earlier (in this case meaning good), and we also have 부탁드립니다. 드립니다 is the formal
                and humble verb meaning “offer” and 부탁 is a noun meaning “a request”. With that in mind the best
                literal translation I can up with is “(I) offer (a) good request (to you).”</p>
            <p>This is definitely a head-scratcher from the English speaker’s perspective, but it makes perfect sense
                in Korean. Not only can it be used when you first meet someone but can also be used at other times too.
                Say you are assigned to work in a group with someone, or you are asking a lawyer for legal help.
                Anytime you see yourself likely to work together, need help from, or desire to get along well with the
                person you’re talking to, you can use this phrase. So, to our dear readers... <i>“잘 부탁드립니다".</i></p>
