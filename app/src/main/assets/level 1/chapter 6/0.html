            <p><i>It’s hard to overstate the importance of vocabulary acquisition in language learning. Words are the
                    names of everything in the world. Knowing names gives you power. Even with impeccable grammatical
                    abilities, the best would-be Korean speakers are often limited by lacking vocabulary. </i></p>

            <p>What are we going to do about this problem? In the early stages of learning a language it is important
                to figure out the grammar and writing system. These are sort of the corner and edge pieces of a puzzle
                that allow you to see what you’re dealing with. Then it’s up to you to fill in the rest of the puzzle
                with vocabulary. If you’ve ever studied Chinese or Japanese, the truth is that you already know some
                Korean. You just need to learn the Korean pronunciation of the words you already know. Even if you
                haven’t studied those languages you know some Korean because over the past few decades South Korea has
                adopted many English words into their language.</p>
            <p>We’ll be talking about many tricks to help you remember vocabulary words, but honestly this is where
                most of the leg work in learning a language comes (along with practicing speaking and reading). In this
                chapter we’ll break our usual rule and be teaching you some phrases that rely on grammar you haven’t
                learned quite yet. We’re doing this for the sake of familiarizing you with some basic greeting and
                get-to-know-you words. This honestly isn’t the most intuitive way to learn a language but it is the
                most common because these are some of the very first words you might use upon arriving in Korea.</p>
            <p>A better way to learn the language is the way we’re doing it—starting with basic words and grammar, and
                working up to their more complicated derivatives. Doing this means that you don’t have to rely on pure
                rote memorization. If you understand the meaning behind what you learn it’s so much easier to retain.
                Nevertheless, the words and phrases we will learn in this chapter are so common that you will be able
                to memorize them and learn their usage even without fully understanding them. Shall we?</p>
