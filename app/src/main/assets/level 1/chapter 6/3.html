        <p>“Nice to meet you” is a must-know phrase for any new language. We can literally translate this one to, “I’m
            happy having met you”. This is one of many situations where Korean fits more grammar in fewer words. In
            this
            case the subject “I” and object “you” are both assumed from context and dropped out of the sentence. What
            we are left with is the verb “만나다” and the adjective “반갑다”. <i>Wait I thought the verb <b>always</b> had to
            go at the end.</i> In this phrase the verb represents one clause and so it is at the end of the clause.
            The adjective 반갑다 is conjugated to (ㅂ/습)니다-form, which is grammar that we’re not ready to go into yet so let's punt
            this one to future chapters. Look forward to it.</p>
        <p>This is the first we’ve seen of formal Korean which is characterize by the (ㅂ/습)니다 ending. Up till now we’ve only had the 요 ending which is
            polite but is not formal. Sometimes there is bleed-through from one form to another. So even if you are meeting
            someone for the first time in an informal situation you are still likely to use the formal ending ~ㅂ니다. The
            reason is that set phrases like this have essentially become form-neutral. You can you use this phrase with
            anyone in any situation. We’ll be seeing more words like this coming up this chapter, and we’ll be going
            more in depth on formalities near the end of Level 1.</p>
