            <p>Here’s a great example of another challenging aspect of Korean. Korean is a language where word choice
                goes beyond just expressing the correct nuance, you also have to
                think more about humity, honorofication, and formality when you make sentences.
                So in Korean there are essentially two polite ways of asking for someone’s name.</p>
            <p>Let's talk about the phrases now. 이름 is a broad word that is typically used for names of people and
                animals. 뭐예요 is a polite what of asking "what is".</p>
            <p>"성함이 어떻게 되세요?" is another phrase that also means “What is your name?” however this is an honorific way
                of saying it. If you
                think someone is older or socially higher than you I’d recommend saying “성함이 어떻게 되세요?” 성함 is an
                honorific word for 이름. I’m sorry to tell you this, but there are a significant number of nouns in
                Korean that have regular and honorific versions, even though they mean the same thing.</p>
            <p>If we translate 성함이 어떻게 되세요 to English we get something like “how does (your) honorable name become?” This is a baffling way to
                ask something in English but we can still figure out what's going on based on this translation. Asking "how it becomes" is an indirect and thus
                more polite way of asking "what it is". In Korean this way of asking is very common and not really so royal-court sounding as it is in English.</p>
