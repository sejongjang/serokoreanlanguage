            <p>And that brings us to the first category we need to talk about—rice. It's hard to overstate the
                importance of rice to the Korean people. Rice is life. Rice isn't just one thing on the plate, it's what
                the plate is made for. Rice is so synonymous with eating, that the word for cooked rice, “밥”, is also
                used as a general word for “meal” or “food”. There is another word, “쌀”, which refers to uncooked rice.
            </p>
            <p>It’s not just rice that you’ll be seeing a lot of in Korea. There are also a large number of
                rice-derivative foods—rice drinks, rice soups, rice pudding, rice wine, and the oh-so-delicious rice
                cake. As was briefly mentioned during the early pronunciation chapters, Koreans call rice cake “떡”.
                Although it is called rice “cake” in English, 떡actually has very little in common with modern western
                cakes. 떡 is created in a process of pounding and refining rice into a thick, chewy substance. This is
                then cut into various shapes depending on how it is to be used. Some common foods include 떡볶이 (spicy
                fried rice cakes) and 떡국 (rice cake soup). In modern times flour is added to many types of 떡, but
                regardless I love the chewy texture and flavor of 떡 and I’m sure you will too!
