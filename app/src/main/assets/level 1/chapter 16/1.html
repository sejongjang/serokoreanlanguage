            <p>Being a peninsula, Korea is also surrounded by water on three sides. This means that Koreans are natural
                lovers of seafood. That doesn’t just mean fish but also shellfish, seaweed, and other forms of aquatic
                life. Go to any coastal town (or any town really) and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Thousands of
                tanks filled with sea creatures line the storefronts, ready to serve the critters up fresh. Here too the
                variety is astonishing. Ask an average westerner to name ten things that you can eat out of the sea and
                they might struggle. Koreans would certainly have no problem. Furthermore, certain seafoods are eaten on
                certain special occasions. For example, it's a tradition to eat seaweed soup on your birthday.
