            <p>Another staple of the Korean food industry is something that Korea is known worldwide for—kimchi. Kimchi
                is most commonly made by soaking cabbage in salt water and then coating it with a flavorful red pepper
                paste. Also included in this paste is other vegetables like radish and garlic, seafood flavoring, and
                sugar. Once the cabbage is thoroughly coated with this paste, it’s put into bins for cold storage and
                begins fermenting.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike pickles or wine or other fermented foods, kimchi can also be eaten right away, before
                fermentation. Certain dishes go well with fresh kimchi, while other dishes (like kimchi stew) more
                commonly employ well-fermented kimchi. Dishes that don’t have kimchi as one of the primary ingredients
                (of which there are many) are often served with kimchi as a side dish. In other words, you better learn
                to like kimchi because it’s do or die if you are in Korea. (Ok they do have plenty of Western fast food
                chains now, but come on, you have to like kimchi!)
