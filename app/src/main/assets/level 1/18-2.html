                <p>어느: Which</p>
                <p>Which school do you attend? "어느 학교 다녀요?"</p>
                <p>Which restaurant tastes better? "어느 식당이 더 맛있어요?"</p>
                <p>Which would be better? "어느 게 좋을까요?"</p>
                <p>Which station should I go to? "어느 역에 가면 돼요?"</p>
                <p>어느 is pretty self-explanitory and used quite the same as in English, so don't worry too much about
                    it. Sometimes it can be switched out for 어떤 in particular sentences but don't worry about that for
                    right now.

                <p>어떻게: How</p>
                <p>How do I go to Gangnam Station? "강남역에 어떻게 가요?"</p>
                <p>How can I hit a homerun? "홈런을 어떻게 칠 수 있어요?"</p>
                <p>How did it go? "어떻게 됐어요?"</p>
                <p>How old are you? "나이가 어떻게 돼요?"</p>
                <p>Same thing with 어떻게, it is used almost identically to the English word "how". Remember that 어떻게 is an adverb of 어떻다 which is used A LOT.  It is conjugated as "어때요"
                </p>
                <p>How is it? "어때요?"
                </p>
                <p>How was it? "어땠어요?"</p>
