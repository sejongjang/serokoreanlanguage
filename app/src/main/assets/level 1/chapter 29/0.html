                <p><i>Hurray, you made it to the last grammar chapter! This chapter on demonstratives is one of the most
                        interesting and fortuitous chapters in this program. Sometimes languages seem to develop
                        chaotically, but in this case, Korean is no doubt one of the most sensical and logical languages
                        in existence.
                    </i></p>
            </div>

            <div class="mstandardpara">
                <p>What is a demonstrative and why is it important enough to be talked about in an introductory-level
                    Korean course? Well for your information we’ve already used three demonstratives just in the
                    introductory paragraph. Demonstratives are words we use to point to things around us, and in Korean
                    they are closely related to many common pronouns as well. Words like, “this”, “that”, “here”,
                    “there”, “this kind”, “that way”, “this much” etc. are all demonstratives.
                </p>
                <p>So what’s so fancy about Korean demonstratives? Well they follow a near-perfect pattern, which can be
                    called the 이/그/저/어 pattern. This pattern is based off of the relative location between the speaker,
                    listener, and objects in question. Relative relationships are something you already understand
                    naturally as an English speaker. For example, you innately understand the difference between “this
                    chair” and “that chair”, right? “This chair” is close to the speaker and not necessarily close the
                    listener. “That chair” is not close to the speaker and may or may not be close to the listener.
                </p>
                <p>Korean functions in a similar way, however you’ll find that with Korean you have more fine-tuned
                    controls. In English we have “this”, and “that”. Korean has “this”, “that”, and “that thing close to
                    neither of us”. Let's take a look at our first Korean demonstrative now.

                        <h3>이 의자

                <p>이 is our first word and it means “this”. <b>Take careful note that this is an adjective.</b> English
                    is a little bit weird because the word “this” can function both as an adjective and a pronoun. In
                    Korean the pronoun version of “this” is “이것”(lit. "this" + "thing").
                    So “이” is “this”, but what about “that”?
                </p>

                <div class="vocab-container">
                    <div class="vocab-item">
                        <h3>그 의자<br>
                            그 것
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>“그” is the next word, meaning “that”, and the mechanics of it function just like “이”. The important
                    thing to remember here is that what you are signaling with “그” is something that is closer to the
                    listener, not the speaker. 그 is also used as the word for abstract things that don’t have a
                    measurable distance associated with them. For example:
                </p>
                <!--No Sound Single Box Introduction-->
                <div class="vocab-container"> 
                    <div class="vocab-item">
                        <h3>그 수업<br>
                            그 게임
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Since "that class" and "that game" don't have a measureable distance from the speaker or listener we
                    can use "그" to refer to them generally. Next up we have the word “저”. 저 is used to point to things
                    that are close to neither the speaker, nor
                    the listener. When describing something far away this is the word to use. In English we use "that"
                    for both 그 and 저.
                </p>
                <!--No Sound Single Box Introduction-->
                <div class="vocab-container">
                    <div class="vocab-item">
                        <h3>저 산<br>
                            저 건물<br>
                            저 분
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>At this point I should point out the fact that in English when something is plural the demonstrative
                    usually changes. For example, “this chair” becomes “these chairs”. Korean has none of this nonsense
                    and you can use the same demonstratives regardless. To make it plural just add “들” onto the noun.
                </p>
                <!--No Sound Single Box Introduction-->
                <div class="vocab-container">
                    <div class="vocab-item">
                        <h3>이 사람들<br>
                            그 책들<br>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Before moving on I’ll just tell you that while I said “이”, and “그” are strictly adjectives, there is
                    one sort-of exception. “이 사람(들)” and “그 사람(들)” can be abbreviated to “이(들)” and “그(들)”. 이 and 그 are
                    male pronouns when used in singular form, but may apply to men and women when plural (sort of like
                    the English pronoun “you guys”).
