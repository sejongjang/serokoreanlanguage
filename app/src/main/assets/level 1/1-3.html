            <p>ㄴ is our next letter. ㄴ is pronounced like “N” (as in “no”). There’s a couple of things to keep in mind
                with the ㄴ sound. You’ll first note that this letter looks suspiciously like the ㄱ letter that we just
                learned, but flipped upside-down. This is no coincidence. We’ll be talking more about similarities
                between letters, but this has to do with the overarching logic behind the alphabet that King Sejong and
                his advisors created.</p>
            <p>Like it’s cousin, ㄴ also has a split personality. What other sound might this letter make? The answer
                may surprise you—it’s the “D” sound! This second personality usually comes out when ㄴ is at the
                beginning of a word. It isn’t the hard and heavy English “D” sound that we sometimes say in words like
                “dog”. Rather it’s pronounced with a lighter flick of the tongue, as in the English word “date”.
                However, remember that ㄴ most often acts like a less-heavy English “N” sound.</p>

                <img src="../img/n-d.jpg" alt="ㄴ" height="100px">
            </div>
            <p>When we pair ㄴ with the vowel ㅏ, it sounds just like the English “N” that you know and love. 나,
                pronounced “nah”, means “me”. You’ve only learned three letters so far but you’ve already learned how
                to write and pronounce a very important word in the Korean language—“me”—Hurray!</p>
            <p>Before we move on, I told you earlier that we must have at least one consonant and one vowel to make a
                syllable. While that’s true, like in English, you can actually have more than two letters. In Korean
                you can put more consonants on the bottom of a syllable block like this:</p>
            <!-- Non-expandable image -->

                <img src="../img/cvcc.jpg" alt="cvcc" height="100px">
            </div>
            <p><b>These bottom letters are called “badchim” (받침)</b>, which literally translates to “support”. In other
                words, the letters on the bottom support, or hold up, the ones on top. Using this structure, we can
                combine the letters you have learned into the syllable blocks 간, 각, 난, and 낙, giving us a total of six
                possible combinations, with 가 and 나 as part of the mix (points for rhyming?). You read these blocks
                left-to-right and top-to-bottom, similar to reading English.</p>
            <p>As shown in the chart above, it is possible to put two consonants on the bottom, forming a
                double-badchim, but keep in mind that this only works for certain letters. The letters ㄱ and ㄴ can
                never combine on the bottom of a syllable block. When we learn the letters that are compatible as
                double-badchim I promise I’ll include them!</p>
            <p>Now that we’ve explained how Hangul characters work, we should be able to move more quickly! First go
                ahead and practice reading these:</p>
