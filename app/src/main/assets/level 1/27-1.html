            <p>Now that we have covered the more formal speech, it’s time for us to cover what form you will be using a
                majority of the time when you speak. This form is known as (이)랑. It means the same thing as 와/과 but with
                a less formal tone to it. It also has the same rules as 와/과 such as only being used with nouns and
                changing when following a vowel or a consonant. For example, when (이)랑 proceeds a noun that ends with a
                vowel like 바지(pants), it will be written as just 랑, and will look like this, 바지랑. When following a noun
                that ends with a consonant such as 가족(family), it will be written as 이랑, thus turning into, 가족이랑. (이)랑
                can also be used with 같이 in normal speech to indicate ‘together with’. Take a moment and compare the
                same nouns in the last example when used with (이)랑 in comparison with 와/과.

            <p>
                Just like we talked about in chapter 3 about carry-over effects, when pronouncing the words with 이랑 the
                last consonant of the noun will fill the space of the ㅇ in 이랑. This is seen in the word, 책이랑’s correct
                pronunciation being 채기랑. As explained in chapter 3, this is done to make Korean flow better and make it
                less staggered. How would the other 이랑 words be pronounced if we kept following this pattern? How would
                any other word be pronounced if a ㅇ directly followed a syllable that ended in a consonant? Hmmm…

            </p>
            <p>No matter what time of the year you are in Korea, there are thousands of festivals, shows, hikes,
                restaurants, and other activities to enjoy. So with with Korea’s 4 seasons in mind, let’s look at what
                we need to know to describe it’s weather patterns and other weather related items.
