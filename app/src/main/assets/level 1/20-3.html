                <p><b><i>Why hasn’t North Korea been democratized yet?

                        </i></b></p>
            </div>

            <p>Since its inception, North Korea’s communist government has proven to be one of the most resilient and
                determined dynastic-regimes in modern history, outlasting even the Soviet Union. Beginning after the end
                of the Korean war, the DPRK has dedicated a huge amount of its resources to military ventures founded
                upon the false narrative that North Korea is the only free sanctuary left in the world. The narrative
                taught to every North Korean citizen from the time they are young is that the United Nations (western
                civilization) and specifically the United States committed inumerable rapes, murders, and a variety of
                inhumane actions such as impaling children on bayonets, severing people’s limbs off, and burning Koreans
                alive during the Korean War. Despite having no proof of these heinous acts, the DPRK government built
                the Shinchon American Atrocities Museum to showcase paintings and models of the indictments against the
                US and encourage hatred toward any western influence.
            </p>
            <p>However, the falsities don’t stop there unfortunately. Schools teach that North Korea is abundantly
                prosperous in comparison to their neighbors to the south. According to North Korean beliefs, due to the
                evils of capitalism and liberalism, South Korea and many other countries throughout the world beg for
                food, live in huts, and suffer from disease and malnutrition. To them, the only protection from the
                evils and hardships that capitalism inevitably brings with it is the Korean version of socialism known
                as, Juche (주체 사상). Despite everyone in the free world knowing that South Korea is one of the most
                prosperous and advanced nations in the world, North Koreans would never know this because travel outside
                of North Korea being strictly forbidden. Actually, even travel between provinces within the DPRK is
                heavily restricted to those who have government approved passes. With that in mind, we can now see that
                fantasies like that of George Orwell’s book 1984 are no longer fiction. Because the citizenry actually
                believes what the government tells them, they have no reason to fight against the government for it acts
                as the only ‘protection’ from the evils of the outside world. As a whole, the country looks to the great
                leader Kim Jung-eun (김정은) and the government for leadership and strength, so any democratization
                movements have been small and, due to communication restrictions, have never reached the entirety of the
                country. Injustices committed against citizens are well known throughout the north but trying to
                organize an overthrow of the government is an uphill battle. The DPRK government consistently taps
                phones, spies on suspicious activity amongst the lower classes or ‘unloyal classes’, restricts
                inter-provincial communication and travel, all while exercising extreme authoritarian control over
                almost every public service.
            </p>
            <p>The short answer is there are 2 distinct reasons why after over 70 years of suffering under communist
                dictatorship North Korea has not been democratized yet. The first being the trust the public has in the
                government to protect them from the made up dangers of the outside world. Thus, despite any injustices
                the government may do to the people, it would hypothetically be better than if another western country
                took over and enslaved everyone, ironic right? The second is because of the extent of control the
                government has over the lives of the populous. Without access to weapons, ways to coordinate
                country-wide protests, ability to freely travel within the country, and influence in the legal system
                there have been no effective or successful reform movements to this day. </p>
