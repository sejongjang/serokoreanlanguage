                        var res = str.replace("(tap for translation)", "This is a chair.");

            <p>In this example we have another word that snuck into the English version of our sentence but isn’t in
                the Korean one. “A” is an article. In English there are exactly three articles, “a”, “an”, and “the”.
                These words have something to do with specifying quantity and singling things out. It’s not really
                important however, because <b>Korean has no articles</b>. Yep let that sink in. Now before you start
                protesting that you won’t know if there’s one chair or millions of chairs, or if the is just <i>a</i>
                chair or
                <i>the</i> chair, slow down and let me explain.</p>
            <p>The truth is that you aren’t losing anything too critical by not having articles in Korean. There is a
                way to delineate plurality, though it’s usage is more flexible. In English if we have more than one
                chair we absolutely must say “chairs”. Korean is different. Without knowing the context of the above
                sentence it would not be inaccurate to translate it as, “These are chairs”. If you must be clear that
                you are dealing with more than one “thing” you can add the postfix “들” onto the end of any noun. Please
                note than 들 is most commonly used when referring to people but, again, can be used with any nouns.</p>

            <div class="sentence-container">
                <div class="sentence-main-item">
                    <h4><audio id="audio2" src="../../audio/euijayeyo.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound2()">개들이에요.</a></h4>
                    <script>
                        function PlaySound2() {
                            var sound2 = document.getElementById("audio2");
                            sound2.play()
                        }
                    </script>
                </div>
                <div class="sentence-translated-item" onclick="replace2()">
                    <h4 id="replace2">(tap for translation)</h4>
                </div>
                <script>
                    function replace2() {
                        var str = document.getElementById("replace2").innerHTML;
                        var res = str.replace("(tap for translation)", "They are dogs.");
                        document.getElementById("replace2").innerHTML = res;
                    }
                </script>
            </div>

            <p>Korean also has a way of specifying if this is “a chair” or “the chair”. You know,
                <i>the one</i>. They do this with demonstrative words, so instead of saying “this is <i>the</i> chair”,
                they would
                say “this is <i>that</i> chair”. We’ll learn how to do this naturally as we continue to wade deeper
                into the
                language. Now some more examples.</p>
