            <p>Before we end chapter 5 there's something we should point out. Those grammar lovers out there will
                recognize that so far we’ve actually only discussed one of two uses of the English verb "to be". In
                English, this verb can express not just state of being, but can also express <i>existence</i>. Take for
                example, “Those are red flowers”, then change a mere two letters to “There are red flowers”, and the
                meaning of the sentence completely changes. The first one states that <b>A</b>(the stuff you’re talking
                about)
                = <b>B</b>(Red flowers). In the second example we have something completely different going on. In this
                case
                it doesn’t equivalate anything but rather is simply making a statement about whether the red flowers
                exist or not.</p>
            <p>Up until now you’ve probably been using these verbs without giving a second thought about whether you
                are expressing equivalency or existence, and that’s great. The problem is that unlike English, <b>Korean
                    has two separate verbs for these two different usage cases</b>. In Korean, the copula 이다 strictly
                expresses
                equivalency. It's only for A = B (or rather A, B, =) sentences.</p>
            <p>So, what is the verb for existence in Korean? It’s 이다’s cousin, "있다". We’ll be learning all about 있다
                coming right up in chapter 7, so go ahead and review this chapter and see how you did with the quiz on
                the next page!</p>
