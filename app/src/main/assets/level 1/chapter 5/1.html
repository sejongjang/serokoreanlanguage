            <p>So now we're ready to meet the Korean copula—이다. All Korean verbs end in “다" when in their base(or
                infinitive) form, but you need to conjugate the verb to put it in a more useable form. We want to
                conjugate 이다 to 요-form to make it more polite (more on the mechanics of conjugation later). When we do
                this it becomes 이에요 or 예요. Why two variations? Well this normally doesn’t happen in Korean, but it has
                to do with another fundamental principle present in the language that I like to call consonant-vowel
                agreement. So now we're ready to meet the Korean copula—이다. <b>All Korean verbs end in “다" when in

            <p>Consonant-vowel agreement factors into many languages but is especially prevalent in Korean. It has to
                do with the awkwardness of a bunch of consonant sounds running into each other. Just imagine if you had
                to pronounce a sentence with no vowels. <i>Blv m t’s xtrmly dffclt.</i>
                In English we actually have a fair amount of words where multiple consonants are strung together in a
                row. Just think of words like “latchstring”, and “catchphrase”. These words have six consonants stuck
                together with no vowels to break them up! While in Korean these kinds of scenarios are possible, the
                trend languages take to make pronunciation easier is to have one vowel sound between every one or two
                consonants.</p>
            <p>To facilitate easier pronunciation there are many pairs like 이에요/예요 in Korean. So for words that end in
                a consonant (meaning they have a 받침) you use 이에요 and for words that end in a vowel (have no 받침) you use
                예요. While 예 is technically a vowel in Korean, like the English letter “Y”, it’s sort of a double agent
                and here is acting as a consonant. Easy enough right? This way of pronouncing things will become very
                natural over time. Let's try some real examples.</p>

            <!-- Example Sentence Grid -->
            <div class="sentence-container">
                <div class="sentence-main-item">
                    <h4><audio src="../../audio/shinbalieyo.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound(this)">신발이에요</a></h4>
                </div>
                <div class="sentence-translated-item" onclick="replace()">
                    <h4 id="replace1">(tap for translation)</h4>
                </div>
                <script>
                    function replace() {
                        var str = document.getElementById("replace1").innerHTML;
                        var res = str.replace("(tap for translation)", "These are shoes.");
                        document.getElementById("replace1").innerHTML = res;
                    }
                </script>
            </div>
            <p>Wait a minute, there’s only two words here—“shoes” and “are”. In our English translation we have three
                words, so what’s going on? Well it turns out that <b>in Korean, parts of the sentence that are understood
                from context are frequently dropped.</b> In fact if you think about it, the whole idea of pronouns (like
                the word “those”) is a little unnecessary. English requires us to delineate what we’re talking about
                even if your audience already knows what it is. In the sentence “Those are shoes”, the word “those”
                just refers to whatever you and the listener already have your attention focused on. Now let's look at another example.</p>
