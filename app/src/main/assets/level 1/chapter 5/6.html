            <p>Hurray, you're finally done learning 한글! And you didn't just learn it, you killed it!</p>
            <p>Now that we have learned how to read Korean we will be able to start digging into Korean grammar. First
                though, we'll take a little break next chapter to talk about the Korean wave. This will also be a
                chance for you to start picking up some vocabulary.</p>
            <p>Go ahead and review below and take the chapter 3 quiz!</p>
            <ul><b>
                    <li>Adding a line onto vowels that have one protruding line adds a "Y" sound in front of the vowel
                        (아-야, 어-여, 오-요, 우-유, 애-얘, and 에-예).</li>
                    <li>으 and 이 don't have y-vowel versions.</li>
                    <li>The compound vowels in 한글(Hangul) are 와, 워, 외, 위, 의, 왜, and 웨.</li>
                    <li>외, 왜, and 웨 all sound the same.</li>
                    <li>에 and 애 sound very similar, and so does 의 when it is acting as a possesive marker.</li>
                    <li>At the beginning (or middle) of a word 의 is pronounced as "으-이", and at the end of a word it
                        just makes an "이" sound.</li>
                    <li>Badchim spelled out in Korean is 받침, and Hangul is 한글.</li>

                    pangram (sentence that has every letter in the alphabet) “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
                    dog.” It turns out Korean also has an entertaining pangram, including all the single consonants and
                    vowels (only a couple of compounds are included): 키스의 고유 조건은 입술끼리 만나야 되고 특별한 요령은 필요치 않다.
