            <p>The last because form we will be going over in this chapter is ~기 때문에. This is the least colloquial of
                the 3 because forms because it is used most often in writing or in more formal speaking. This is used
                the same as the others where the reason for the result is put first, followed by ~기 때문에, and ends with
                the result. This form is a bit more complicated because it uses something called a “gerund” which
                basically is how you can change a verb into a noun.
            </p>
            <p> For example, the verb “to eat” is turned into “eating” in order to say, “I like eating”. In this
                sentence “like” is the verb and we need a way to change the verb “to eat” into an object the verb can
                act on. This is the purpose of gerunds. Anyways, we won't get into gerunds too much right now but we
                will go over gerunds in depth and the many kinds of gerunds you will see in korean in chapter 41 of
                level 2. Now how do we work with this grammar form?
            </p>
            <p>The gerund in this case is “기" added onto our verb stem without the 다. We insert 때문에 after followed by
                the result of this.
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">
                <p>

                    1. Add 기 to the Verb stem<br>
                    수영하다 ---> 수영하--->수영하기(swimming)<br>
                    만들다--->만들--->만들기(making)<br>
                    먹다--->먹--->먹기(eating)<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Attach 때문에<br>
                    수영하기 + 때문에<br>
                    맏들기 + 때문에<br>
                    먹기 + 때문에



                </p>
            </div>


            <p>Simple right? Let’s look at an example sentence and the english translation so we can start to get a feel
                how this form is structured.
                <div class="center_context">
                    저는 많이 일하기 때문에 피곤해요 (일하다 - to work)<br>
                    I am tired because I work a lot <br>
                    폰은 너무 비싸기 때문에 못사요 (폰 - cellphone)(비싸다 - to be expensive)<br>
                    I can’t buy the phone because it is too expensive

                </div>
                <p>You can also leave off the 에 and replace it with 이다 to just express the reason. For example…
                </p>
                <div class="center_context">
                    너무 바쁘기 때문이에요 (바쁘다 - to be busy)<br>
                    Because I am too busy

                </div>
                <p>The last trick to using ~기 때문에 is knowing that you can use past tense with it as well.
                </p>
                <div class="center_context">
                    저는 너무 많이 먹었기 때문에 배 불러요 (배 부르다 - to be full (stomach))<br>
                    I'm full because I ate too much

                </div>
                <p><i>*You may hear people say 땜에 instead of 때문에. Do not panic! This is just a contraction that some
                        people use despite it not being grammatically correct.

                    </i></p>
