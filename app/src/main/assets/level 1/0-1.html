                <p>Learning Korean is a real adventure and provides an absolutely intriguing and mind-expanding take on
                    communication. Korean is fascinating because Korean and English grammar are about as different as
                    kimchi
                    and cupcakes. To paraphrase a friend of mine who used to teach Korean, <i>“Korean is upside down,
                        inside
                        out, and backwards from English.”</i> But hey, no pain no gain, right? Let's look at an example.
                    </p> 
                <!-- Modal Image 1-->
                <a href="#openModal1"><img src="../img/structure.png" alt="Structure Example" class="modalimg"></a>
                <div id="openModal1" class="modal-grammar-dialog">
                    <a href="#close" title="Close" class="close">
                        <div>
                            <p>You can see things are really mixed up.</p>
                            <img src="../img/structure.png" alt="Structure Example">
                        </div>
                    </a>
                </div>
                <span class="smallscreen"><i class="subtext">Tap to enlarge. Rotate screen horizontally to enlarge further.</i></span>
                <p>You'll note that in Korean the verb comes at the end! Your brain, however, is an incredible tool, and
                    I am confident that with persistence, what may initially seem
                    baffling is actually going to become very easy. Soon you'll be listenting to these backwards
                    sentences like a champ. You may even catch yourself saying things like,
                    <i>“Dang, why is English so hard? It’s much better to do this the Korean way!”</i></p>
                <p>What’s more is that we’re going to do this the easy way. We'll explain everything clearly and give a
                    ton
                    of examples as we go along. You’ll have native pronunciation for every example sentence provided,
                    and
                    you can break down every sentence to see all the parts in it. We’ll start from the bottom and work
                    our
                    way up, alternating frequently between reviewing and learning new content. That way you can keep
                    learning quickly while solidifying what you have already learned. We’ll continually identify
                    patterns
                    and draw comparisons, thus, unraveling the seemingly complex code of Korean communication into
                    manageable bite-size chunks.</p>
