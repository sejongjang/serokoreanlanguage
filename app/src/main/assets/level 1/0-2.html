                <p>Rather than dividing the program into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, Sero Korean is
                    divided into numbered levels. This approach gives us the flexibility to continue to add valuable
                    content at a reasonable pace. Each level countains 30 chapters, and the chapters are not long. In
                    fact,
                    each chapter is designed to be completed within 20-30 minutes. This enables anyone to find
                    time to do at least one chapter per day and complete an entire level in just one month.</p>
                <p>Level one totals in at over 50,000 words, with 300+ examples sentences (including native-speaker
                    recordings), 500+ vocabulary words, and much more. You should never feel
                    like you’re drowning, since we’ve worked hard to strike the right balance between pushing forward
                    quickly and taking enough time to understand concepts thoroughly.</p>
                <p>Now is also a good time to mention that there are quizzes at the end of most chapters. (There are a
                    few culture chapters where we just want to give you a break). Some chapters will have grammar
                    quizzes, some will have vocabulary quizzes, and some will have both. Don't sweat these too much
                    because you can always retake them. Additionally, once you take the quiz on a vocabulary word it
                    will be added to your 'In-progress' list, which you can find in the 'Vocab' section of the app.</p>

                <p>Some sections also feature popouts which contain notes from the authors. If you are just trying to
                    finish as fast as you can feel free to skip over these pop-outs as <u>they contain no vital
                        information.</u> Tap on the arrow here to see what they look like.</p>

                        less than textbook-worthy we've decided to put them here. Upcoming author's notes will
                        feature the author's name (someone from the Sero Language team) and likely many personal
                        anecdotes. Look forward to it &#128578.</p>
