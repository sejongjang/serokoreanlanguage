            <p>Before wrapping up this chapter there are a few "special cases", or unexpected sounds, we need to talk about. Mostly these have
                to do with carry-over sounds. We've actually alaredy talked about some of these. Those are shown below.</p>
                <ul><b>
                        <li>Despite making other sounds on top, the letters make a t-stop sound in the 받침 position are ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ, and also ㅆ.</li>
                        <li>ㄴ-ㄹ and ㄹ-ㄴ carry-over sounds turn a ㄴ into a ㄹ(한리=할리 and 할니=할리)</li>
                        <li>ㄱ-ㄴ and ㄱ-ㅁ carry-over sounds turn ㄱ into a 받침 ㅇ(학년=항년 and 학문=항문)</li>
                        <li>ㄷ-ㄴ and ㄷ-ㅁ carry-over sounds turn ㄷ into a ㄴ(핟니=한니 and 핟미=한미)</li>
                        <li>ㅂ-ㄴ,ㅂ-ㄹ,ㅂ-ㅁ carry-over sounds turn ㅂ into ㅁ and, when applicable, ㄹ into ㄴ(합니=함니 and 합리=함니 and 합미=함미)</li>
                        <li>ㅎ has the special ability to make non-aspirated consonants sound aspirated(어떻게=어떠케 or 낮히=나치).</li>
                    </b></ul>

            <p>These are some of the unexpected behaviors we've gone over but there are a few moreFragment we need let let you know about. We'll start with the m-stop sound.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>It turns out that the letter ㅂ and ㅍ, which are derived from ㅁ, act like ㅁ does before ceratain letters when they are in the 받침 posistion.</p>
