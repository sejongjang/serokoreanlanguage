            <p>Before wrapping up this chapter there are a few "special cases", or unexpected sounds, we need to talk about. Mostly these have
                to do with carry-over sounds. We've actually alaredy talked about some of these. Those are shown below.</p>
                <ul><b>
                        <li>Despite making other sounds on top, the letters make a t-stop sound in the 받침 position are ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ, and also ㅆ.</li>
                        <li>ㄴ-ㄹ carry-over sounds like a ㄹ-ㄹ carry-over.</li>
                        <li>ㅎ has the special ability to make non-aspirated consonants sound aspirated.</li>
                    </b></ul>

            <p>These are some of the unexpected behaviors we've gone over but there are a few more we need let let you know about. We'll start with the m-stop sound.</p>

            <p>It turns out that the letter ㅂ and ㅍ, which are derived from ㅁ, act like ㅁ does before ceratain letters when they are in the 받침 posistion.</p>
