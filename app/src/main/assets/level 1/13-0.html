                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Welcome, welcome. Hopefully, you enjoyed that
                        second chapter about numbers. Please settle down somewhere
                        cozy and quiet so you can focus on one of the most important chapter in all of Sero Korean. Here
                        we
                        will begin to harness the power of Korean verbs. This chapter we’re going to be learning past,
                        present, and future conjugations for the 요-polite ending we’ve already been using. </i></p>

            </div>

            <div class="mstandardpara">

                <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>nce you get into the mechanics of verb
                    conjugation, it can get quite messy in many languages. With
                    Korean, the traditional methods of teaching verb conjugation would definitely stray into that messy
                    territory, but lucky for us there’s a better method. This method is excellent because it teaches the
                    underlying logic behind what happens when verbs are conjugated. Again, this is much moreFragment simple and
                    effective than trying to force your brain to remember what happens with every type of verb and
                    verb-ending.

                </p>
                <p><b>In Korean there are three basic ways we can use verbs:</b>
                    <br><b>1)</b> In base (infinitive) form as in 먹<u>다</u>
                    <br><b>2)</b> With a connector (like glue) as in "먹<u>어</u>"
                    <br><b>3)</b> With a conjugated ending as in "먹<u>어요</u>"
                </p>

                <p>The base form of Korean verbs is useful in many instances but not nearly as useful as a verb with a
                    connector and/or ending such as the infinitive "to eat" in English. Connectors are especially useful
                    because they are the middle step between our inifinitive and our conjugated final product. However,
                    we can sometimes stop with a connector without fully conjugating the verb in Korean, you'll see what
                    we mean later. Finally, conjugated endings are what almost all languages use for formal and
                    sometimes
                    informal speach. For example, we never say, "I <u>to eat</u> hot dogs". We always conjugate the
                    infinitve "to eat" in order to say, " I <u>eat</u> hot dogs" or "He <u>eats</u> hot dogs". See how
                    important conjugation is? </p>

                    <p><b><i>새로 팀</i></b><br>Glue is not our creation. It was invented by the excellent teachers at the
                        Missionary Training Center (MTC) for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Provo,
                        Utah. All credit goes to the original
                        creators. In the MTC, missionaries are trained for about two months before being sent off to
                        share
                        their beliefs in Korea (and many other countries). The teachers in the MTC needed an effective
                        method to get the missionaries conjugating verbs correctly in a very short amount of time so
                        this is
                        the system they came up with. The Glue method is being shared here with permission.

                    chapter title kind of gave it away).
                    Glue is the most important connecter because it is used for creating tenses, connecting words, and of course for the verb ending—요. Well then,
                    whithout further ado let's get started learning glue shall we?
