                <p>So about K-pop... it's getting crazy popular! And not just popular in Asia, but popular across the
                    world. Although Korean culture has been making strides in Asia for decades a worldwide breakthrough
                    came with the YouTube hit “Gangnam
                    Style”. Psy’s masterpiece of humor held the YouTube view-number crown for years, and besides Gangnam style
                    there’s now at least 35 other Korean Pop (often abbreviated to K-pop) videos with more than 100 million
                    views! </p>
                <p>Many people attribute this surge in worldwide popularity to the Korean penchant for “manufactured” stars. Entertainment
                    companies
                    often recruit young teenagers or even children through auditions and scouting, and then they train them for
                    years before their big debut. The companies pair the trainees with professional vocal, dance, and
                    even
                    acting instructors. Those who perform well are promised a future of fame and fortune, while those
                    who
                    can’t keep up or handle the pressure of such a competitive system are let go and return to regular
                    student life.</p>
                <p>The critics of such a system say that it’s too artificial and doesn’t allow for artists outside the
                    mainstream to succeed. They also worry about the ethical issues of long-term contracts with onerous
                    terms being signed by teenagers. Furthermore, they argue that company comes before art, stifling
                    creativity.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, it’s hard to argue with the success of the star-factory that is the Korean
                    entertainment industry. Advocates say that this system allows people to develop skills far beyond
                    what
                    they would have been able to without the professional help the companies give them. As in all other
                    forms of business, competition drives the bar ever-higher, and the music, choreography, and film
                    produced is definitely impressive. Celebrities are also held to a high bar of behavior and there is
                    great pressure (and perhaps contractual obligations) pushing them to be good role models for the
                    general public. This contrasts starkly with the behavior of other stars internationally who are
                    basically self-managed. </p>
                <p>More recently there’s also been a push to broaden the international appeal of Korean entertainment,
                    as
                    evidenced by the recruitment of stars from other countries in Asia and Koreans raised in other
                    countries throughout the world. Many Korean songs are produced not just in Korean, but also in
                    Chinese,
                    Japanese, and/or English. Korean stars learn many languages and frequently take international tours.
