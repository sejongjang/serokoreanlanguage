            <p>The Korean music industry has been no slouch either. For proof you need look no further than Youtube’s
                most-viewed videos chart—one of the most viewed videos on Youtube is the incredibly famous “Gangnam
                Style”. Psy’s masterpiece of humor held the view-number crown for years, and besides Gangnam style
                there’s at least 35 other Korean Pop (often abbreviated to K-pop) videos with more than 100 million
                views! </p>
            <p>Many people attribute this to the Korean penchant for “manufactured” stars. Big entertainment companies
                often recruit very young children through auditions and through scouts, and then they train them for
                years before their big debut. The companies pair the trainees with professional vocal, dance and even
                acting instructors. Those who perform well are promised a future of fame and fortune, while those who
                can’t keep up or handle the pressure of such a competitive system are let go and return to regular
                student life.</p>
            <p>The critics of such a system say that it’s too artificial and doesn’t allow for artists outside the
                mainstream to succeed. They also worry about the ethical issues of long-term contracts with onerous
                terms being signed by teenagers. Furthermore, they argue that company comes before art, stifling
                creativity.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it’s hard to argue with the success of the star-factory that is the Korean
                entertainment industry. Advocates say that this system allows people to develop skills far beyond what
                they would have been able to without the professional help the companies give them. As in all other
                forms of business, competition drives the bar ever-higher, and the music, choreography, and film
                produced is definitely impressive. Celebrities are also held to a high bar of behavior and there is
                great pressure (and perhaps contractual obligations) pushing them to be good role levelCards for the
                general public. This contrasts starkly with the behavior of other stars internationally who are
                basically self-managed. </p>
            <p>More recently there’s also been a push to broaden the international appeal of Korean entertainment, as
                evidenced by the recruitment of stars from other countries in Asia and Koreans raised in other
                countries throughout the world. Many Korean songs are produced not just in Korean, but also in Chinese,
                Japanese, and/or English. Korean stars learn many languages and frequently take international tours.
