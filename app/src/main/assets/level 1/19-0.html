                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Remember the phrase, “만나서 반갑습니다”? That was our first taste of Korean adjectives. In English,
                    adjectives and verbs are completely different in both form and function. As it turns out
                    however,
                    there is a very fine line between adjectives and verbs in Korean. The purpose of this chapter is
                    to
                    explain how to use and conjugate adjectives, as well as to inform you of the subtle (but
                    important)
                    differences between adjectives and verbs in the Korean language.</i></p>
                

            </div>

            <div class="mstandardpara">
                <p>Wait what? Adjectives and verbs are similar? What does that mean? Well consider the difference
                    between these two sentences in English.</p>
                <div class="center_context">Sarah is a pretty girl. <br>
                    Sarah is pretty.
                </div>
                <p>Functionally the two sentences have the same meaning, but there are some important grammatical
                    distinctions to be made here. In the first sentence “pretty” is modifying the word “girl”. Now you
                    could
                    argue that the second sentence is basically the same (since Sarah is assumed to be a girl) but
                    that’s
                    not really true. Remember when we talked about how the copula is also known as a “linking” verb?
                    What’s
                    going on in the second sentence is that the noun “Sarah” is being linked to, or associated with,
                    “pretty”. Sarah = pretty.

                </p>
                <p>Korean simplifies this process significantly because in Korean, adjectives have the “linking verb”
                    built
                    into them. I’ll write these sentences in Korean to show you, so check it out. Keep in mind that the
                    base
                    form of the adjective “to be pretty” is “예쁘다”.</p>

                <div class="center_context">
                    <p>사라는 예쁜 여자예요.<br>
                        사라가 예뻐요. (Comparative i.e. Sarah is the the one who’s pretty)

                <p>Whoa, whoa! What is going on here?! Let’s tackle these one at a time.
