            <p>Another thing to take note of is that 으 behaves a little bit strangely because despite technically being
                an 어-group vowel, it can sometimes switch allegiances. </p>
            <!--No Sound Single Box Introduction-->

                    <h3>끄다 → 끄어요 → 꺼요
                    </h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>When 으 is all by itself, it acts like an 어-vowel. When we conjugate 끄다 it acts like an 어-vowel
                (in absence of any other vowels) and we add the harmonizing 어 glue to give us 끄어요. Here’s where
                things
                get weird. Since 으 is a neutral vowel it is absorbed into the 어 sound. The resulting verb is 꺼요, not
                끄어요
            </p>
            <p>But what happens when 으 is influenced by an 아-group vowel?
            </p>

            <div class="vocab-container">
                <div class="vocab-item">
                    <h3>잠그다 → 잠그아요 → 잠가요
                    </h3>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As we saw above with verbs like 고르다 and 잠그다,
                으 is also overruled by the 아-vowels. 고르다 becomes 골라요 and 잠그다 becomes 잠가요. So just remember that 으
                has no personality of it’s own, and gets absorbed into whatever vowels are around it. The one noteable
                exception to the exception is "만들다" (to make). 만들다 co njugates to 만들어요.
