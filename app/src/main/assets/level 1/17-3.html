                <p>Since we’re talking about 에 it’s also important that we talk about “서”. We use the marker “서” after 에
                    sometimes to indicate that something is actively happening in relation to what you’re marking. So in
                    this case there is going to be a game held at the stadium. Because the event is happening from this
                    location then 에서 is used. For example, if someone asks us where the party is going to be held then
                    we can respond by saying, "우리 집에서 할거예요" or "at our house". Because the event or action is happening
                    at a specific location we use 에서.
                </p>
                <p>But how does this differ in usage from 에? We can contrast 에서 with 에 by using the example of going to
                    the mart. "마트에 가요" doesnt use 에서 because no event is taking place at the mart but rather we are at a
                    different location attempting to travel to the mart. Another example could include the sentence,
                    "the car is at homeFragment". This would be "차가 집에 있어요" and NOT "차가 집에서 있어요" XX. This may be describing
                    somehting at a different location but it is only describing the location of the item, in this case,
                    the car. Therefore, whenever we are describing where a certain event, action, or custom happens we
                    can use 에서, but when describing direction or location of an item then 에 is used. </p>
