                <p>To wrap up our cultural break here, an important thing to know about Korea is it’s belief system. 56%
                    of the South is atheist while of the remaining 44%, 65% are Christian and 35% practice Buddhism.
                    North Korea actually had been visited first by christian missionaries before the war and were much
                    more christian than the South until the Soviet government forbade any form of religion to be
                    practiced after WWII. Also, Korea had been indoctrinated with principles of Confucianism earlier in
                    in the Joseon dynasty, but those ideologies still exist within all people both with and without a
                    religion today so respect, honor, morality, and dignity are key in all facets of society!</p>
                <p>Korean History is so mind-blowing that one chapter could not possibly cover all of its mysteries and
                    glory. The more you know of how Korea came to be, the more aware of cultural practices you will be
                    as well. Thus, helping you on your path to fluency and becoming a ‘Korean Master’.</p>
