                <p>얼마(나): How much (amounts)</p>
                <p>How much is it? "얼마예요?"</p>
                <p>How long have you been in Korea? "한국에 온지 얼마나 됐어요?"</p>
                <p>How happy are you? "얼마나 행복해요?"</p>
                <p>How much money do you have? "돈 얼마 있어요?"</p>
                <p>You're probably wondering what the difference between 얼마 and 얼마나 is. The short and weet general rule
                    is 얼마 is used for exact amounts such as prices. Whereas 얼마나 is used for general amounts such as
                    things that may not be measurable or time. For example, if we ask, "돈 얼마 있어요" we are asking exactly
                    how much someone has down to the cent but if we ask, "돈 얼마나 있어요" then we just want a general amount
                    like $20 to make sure they have enough for something.</p>
