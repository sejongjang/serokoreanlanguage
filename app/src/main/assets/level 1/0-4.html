                <p>Korean, like English, has a lot of subtle sounds that your ear will have to grow accustomed to. These
                    sounds are arranged in a way that can seem almost alien to westerners. Developing an ability to
                    listen
                    to Korean will be one of the main hurdles we deal with in Sero Korean Level 1. Fortunately, since
                    you
                    speak English you already use most of the sounds found in Korean during regular everyday speech.</p>
                <p>Another thing to consider is that Korean is a lot more consistent than English is when it comes to
                    representing the sounds of the language in writing. It’s going to be easier to learn to read Korean
                    using Korean letters, than it is trying to learn Korean using English letters.</p>
                <p>A lot of apps/textbooks try and make you use romanization to learn, which is a crutch and is
                    completely unnecessary in Korean. In fact pronunciation of Korean words is actually so hard to
                    represent in English that it would do more harm than good to teach it. Just to prove how bad English
                    is look at this chart containing the two most well recognized systems of romanization. (In Korean
                    the
                    revised system is used on signs to help foreigners get around.)

                <p>Go ahead and try reading one of these romanizations. You almost certainly won't be able to come up
                    with a sentence that could be understood by Koreans. None of these systems are good because English
                    letters are just incompatible with Korean sound patterns. Now listen to the real pronunciation of
                    the sentence.</p>
