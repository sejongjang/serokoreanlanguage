            <p><i>So far we’ve learned enough to describe how, why, and when things have happened. But how do we express
                    the where? Describing the location of something in relation to others is a vital tool to have when
                    trying to communicate in another language and prepositions help us do just that. Prepositions are
                    words that describe location like the following words under, on, beside, inside, outside, to the
                    left/right, etc. Without prepositions, describing where something is would be pretty difficult in
                    any language, let alone Korean. This chapter is designed to help you understand how to use Korean
                    prepositions to describe location so that you can say more with less.

            <p>Let's meet the prepositions we will be working with in this chapter.
