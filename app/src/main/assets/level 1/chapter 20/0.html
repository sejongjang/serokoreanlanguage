                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>It is with a sympathetic heart that we approach the subject of North Korean in this culture chapter.
                    Although western sentiment is often less than sympathetic to the citizens of North Korea, we feel
                    for the humble citizens of the mysterious hermit-kingdom. Currently they live under some of the most
                    strenuous economic and socio-political circumstances in the world. Basic needs for nutrition,
                    sanitation, and shelter continuously go unmet for the underprivileged members of North Korean
                    society. The voices of the suffering are ignored—even trodden down by the current regime which rules
                    the North with an iron fist. Perhaps worst of all, many North Koreans know little of the outside
                    world. If only they knew the truth it might give them the courage to rise up and regain their
                    country and their freedom. I’ll address a few common questions about North Korea in this chapter,
                    but I’ll warn you that a lot of this is just my personal opinions and feelings having only lived in
                    the South.</i></p>
