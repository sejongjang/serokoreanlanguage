            <p>A second war with North Korea, otherwise known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), has
                been on the collective minds of US and Korean military planners since the original Korean War concluded
                in 1953. The war ended in a ceasefire with no official peace treaty ever having been signed (although
                talk of such a treaty has been brought up again recently). Since the war, the line dividing the North
                and South has become the single most highly militarized and well guarded border in the world. Both
                countries have engaged in aggravating practices such as using loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda
                across the border and sending balloons filled with anti-communist/ capitalist flyers over the border to
                pop over certain cities in order to influence the citizenry to defect to the other side. Since 1953,
                there have been an estimated 150,000 ~ 300,000 North Korean defectors and approximately 340 South Korean
                defectors, with only around 7 coming after 1980, reported. Needless to say, tensions are almost always
                high between the two countries as the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is ironically the most armed place on the
                planet.

            </p>
            <p>Both countries spend enormous amounts of money on their military in comparison to their GDP. South Korea
                spends over $38 Billion annually (2.7% of GDP) while North Korea spends 40% of their GDP on military
                expenditures, amounting to $10 Billion dollars annually. North Korea can get away with spending massive
                amounts of money on the military by telling the people the efforts are going towards “freeing the South
                from capitalist terrors”. Many in the North have been taught that South Korea is a very poor country and
                because of capitalism a majority of the population is begging for food. In order to overthrow the evils
                of western civilization and capitalism, the North must maintain a strong military so as to be ready for
                any threat.
            </p>
            <p>With that in mind, considering the United States and United Nations holding military bases in South
                Korea, Japan, Guam, Marshall Islands, etc. North Korea will never willingly start a war because they
                would be completely overpowered and loose within hours. North Korean leadership is smart and knows that
                the only chance they have of “freeing” the south is by peacefully unifying under 3 pre-conditions
                outlined in the book, “...”. 1. The withdrawal of US troops from South Korea 2. Repeal of the National
                Security Law and 3. Legalize activities of the Communist Party in South Korea. Without all 3 of these
                conditions met, the North has very little chance of ever unifying with the South because these 3
                pre-requisites all tie into a North Korean philosophy they have adhered to since the 1960’s. It’s called
                적화통일(Red Unification) or Unification under the creed of communism. Anything less than a 100% communist
                controlled government agreement will not do for the North. As long as those 3 conditions are met, any
                sacrifices in policy made by the North will be made up for once a political cout d’etate takes over the
                entire peninsulas power.
            </p>
            <p>So, is war with North Korea inevitable? In short, no. Short term results would require military action to
                force the north to relinquish political power. However, the current world leaders are playing the long
                term game with the North. Knowing how weak and unstable the communist economy is and how unsatisfied the
                people are with their living conditions, waiting until the government completely collapses or until they
                come to a deal not including their 3 conditions before freeing the north is the current plan. Until that
                time, creating non-hostile relations with the North is our best bet.
