            <p><i>Great job on the last chapter. This next one also deals with fundamental grammar, but it should be
                    more straightforward. You’ll do great!



                </i></p>

        <div class="mstandardpara">

            <p>In English we have many words that can express utilization. These include words like “by”, “through” and
                “with”. We use these words when we want to say how something is accomplished. Naturally Korean also has
                a way of expressing what means things are done with, and in this case it’s a powerful particle known as
                (으)로. You’ll soon find yourself using (으)로 a lot.


            </p>
            <p>(으)로 attaches to nouns (like the other particles we’ve learned) and it follows a now-familiar pattern of
                subject-verb agreement. For words that end in 받침 we use “으로” and for words that end in vowels we use
                “로”. (으)로 is unique however because there is one exception to this rule as you’ll see below.

            </p>

            <div class="center_context">
                펜으로 (with/by pen)<br>
                목소리로 (with/by voice i.e. spoken)<br>
                연필로 (with/by pencil)

            </div>
            <p>As you can see words ending in ㄹ have 로 attached making the the “ll” carry-over sound. Let’s try some
                example sentences now.
            </p>
            <div class="center_context">마트에 자동차로 가요.<br>
                종이를 가위로 자를게요.<br>
                파인애플로 디저트를 만들었어요.
            </div>
            <p>One thing we should note here is the effect that word order has on the sentence. Marking the means of
                doing something right before the verb, as in “자동차로 가요”, emphasizes how it was done. “Go to the mart by
                car”. On the other hand, in “파인애플로 디저트를 만들었어요”, we can see that making dessert is being emphasized. So
                remember the most important part of the sentence should come near the end. This even holds true with
                particles like 은/는 and 이/가 which typically appear near the beginning of a clause.

            </p>
            <p>밥을 제가 만들었어요. (I am the one who made the rice (or meal)).
                제 친구가 착해서 그런 것을 할 사람은 아니에요. (My friend is nice so he is not the type of person to do that.)
            </p>
            <!--*Also teach “적” like 결과적으로 (how 로 can make nouns into adverbs) and using it for directions like 오른쪽으로 or 학교로 가요.
