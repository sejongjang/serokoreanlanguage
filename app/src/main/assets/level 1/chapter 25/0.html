            <p><i>So far we’ve been using some Korean names as characters for our little mock dialogue sections, but you
                    may have been wondering about the naming conventions behind these characters’ names. I’ll reveal the
                    mystery in this chapter and also help you figure out what to call your Korean friends (hint: you
                    usually don’t call them by their name).

            <p>In few areas are the differences between the western world and Korea as prominent as they are when it
                comes to addressing others. The naming and title conventions of the Far East always take some getting
                used to for westerners. One thing people find especially disconcerting when learning Korean is the lack
                of one easy word to address someone (in English others can comfortably be called ‘you’). There’s a great
                TED video explaining the concept of ‘you’ in other languages, if you’re interested in checking in out:
                TED-Ed: One of the most difficult words to translate... Don’t fret however, here again, different
                doesn’t mean bad. We’ll start with the enjoyable names section.

            </p>
            <p>Korean names are fun! They developed in a different way than English names, but I’ll start with the
                similarities. In Korea people do have family names that are passed down from generation to generation
                like in English-speaking countries. The name is also passed down through the paternal line, like
                English-countries... and that’s about the extent of the similarities. Oh and there are boy names, girl
                names, and names that work for both genders just like English (it’ll take some time to be able to
                distinguish between these).
