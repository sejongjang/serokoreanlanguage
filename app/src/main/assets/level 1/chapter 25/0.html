            <p><i>Great job on the last chapter. This next one also deals with fundamental grammar, but it should be
                    more straightforward. You’ll do great!

            <p>In English we have many words that can express utilization. These include words like “by”, “through” and
                “with”. We use these words when we want to say how something is accomplished. Naturally Korean also has
                a way of expressing what means things are done with, and in this case it’s a powerful particle known as
                (으)로. You’ll soon find yourself using (으)로 a lot.


            </p>
            <p>(으)로 attaches to nouns (like the other particles we’ve learned) and it follows a now-familiar pattern of
                subject-verb agreement. For words that end in 받침 we use “으로” and for words that end in vowels we use
                “로”. (으)로 is unique however because there is one exception to this rule as you’ll see below.
