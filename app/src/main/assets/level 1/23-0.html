                    <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>In this chapter we’ll be exploring the uses of
                            a very important new particle—the possessive
                            marker.
                            While possessives in English can be confusing it’s very simple in Korean.</i></p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">J</span>ae-young’s bike, Seung-woo’s boat,
                        the flag of South Korea, the first day of school—all of these
                        demonstrate possession. The bike is of Jae-young, the flag is of Korea. In communication it is
                        useful to
                        categorize things in these ways. It’s an important way to specify the relationships things in
                        the
                        world
                        have.
                    </p>
                    <p>In Korean, ownership and categorization are both expressed through a single, powerful particle—의.
                        This
                        particle, like all other Korean particles, sticks onto the end of nouns, and defines that noun’s
                        function. We can basically think of 의 as the Korean version of “Apostrophe-S”. This is because 의
                        follows
                        the same order. 재영의 자전거 = Jae-young’s bike. Fortunately 의 doesn’t have any alternate form and
                        stays
                        the
                        same whether it comes after a consonant or a vowel. For example 우리의/한국의.


                    </p>
                    <p>However, an important thing to note is 의's pronunciation. The possesive 의 found at the end of a
                        noun is pronounced as 에. This is the result of a chagne over time in korean speakers electing to
                        differentiate it with words that actually contain 의 in the world, usually meaning intention or
                        righteousness, and to make speaking flow better as 에 at the end of nouns flows a lot better than
                        의 does pronunciation wise. But since 에 already has it's grammatical role then we can see why
                        they still use 의 instead of just changing it completely to 에. Therefore, 우리의 = 우리에 and 한국의 =
                        한국에(한구게) pronunciation wise.</p>

                        <p><i>The problem is that you don’t always pronounce it as 에. When 의 appears combined with other letters, or
                            inside of words it’s more often pronounced with it’s original 으-이, sound. You can hear this in
                            examples like 거의 (Almost), 의견 (Opinion), and 띄다 (To stand out).
