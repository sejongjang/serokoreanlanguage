            <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>t’s hard to overstate the magnitude of the tragedy that led to one of the most homogenous and harmonious
                nations on Earth being torn asunder by civil war and ultimately being split into two different
                countries. The story begins with Japanese occupation prior to World War II. At that time Korea was under
                the thumb of the Japanese emperor.
            </p>
            <p>We won't go into depth of the imperialistic past of the Japanese empire, but suffice it to say that
                Koreans were suffering under great oppression. They were beaten if they spoke their native tongue,
                forced into serving for the japanese military in various wars including WWII, and were forced to change
                their korean names to japanese in order to conform with cultural assimilation laws. There are many
                heroic accounts of resistance to Japanese occupation and have lived on in the hearts of Koreans to this
                day.
            </p>
            <p>In 1945 after WWII had ended, Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan, having been defeated by the West, were
                forced to pay for war reparations and give up all the territory they had gained through conquest. As the
                United States set up a democratic government while temporarily occupying Japan, Korea was then set
                free to become an autonomous nation once more. You can imagine the excitement, relief, and overwhelming
                sense of gratitude the Korean people felt after having been released from their 35 year occupation. With
                aid from the UN, Korea started to grow industrially and began to re-establish their native language
                and culture into their society, getting rid of any sign of Japanese occupation from the past 3 decades.
            </p>
            <p>In the midst of Korea’s new liberated republic, tensions between the Soviet Union and United States began
                to grow as the USSR betrayed the western powers and took over eastern germany and most of eastern
                europe. Eager to spread the newly revolutionized communist political system, the Soviet Union along with
                China influenced the north part of the korean peninsula and invaded the south. The United States and
                United Nations, hoping to avoid an entirely communist eastern asian front, continued to back the south
                and fought alongside South Korea to push back. The battle went back and forth for a couple years ending
                in a cease fire at the 38th parallel, a line which still constitutes the current border between the two
                countries.
