            <p>It’s just that simple… for present tense. You thought the chapter was over right? Wrong! Now for past
                tense—this is where things get fun. With past tense we go to where we were in step three of present
                tense conjugation, but then we add a ㅆ in the 받침 position. Check it out.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="mstandardpara">
            <!--No Sound Single Box Introduction-->
            <div class="vocab-container">
                    <div class="vocab-item">
                        <h3>1. 가다 → 2. 가아 → 3. 가+ㅆ=갔<br>
                            1. 먹다 → 2. 먹어 → 3. 먹어+ㅆ=먹었
                        </h3>

                </div>


            <p>Now we have the past tense stems of our original verbs. <b>The next step is to apply another layer of
                    glue.</b>
                This new layer of glue is easy, however, because <b>the second layer of glue doesn’t rely on harmony.
                It’s simply always “어”.</b> So, the next step is:</p>

            <!--No Sound Single Box Introduction-->
            <div class="vocab-container">
                    <div class="vocab-item">
                        <h3>1. 가다 → 2. 가아 → 3.갔 → 4. 갔어<br>
                            1. 먹다 → 2. 먹어 → 3.먹었 → 4. 먹었어
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
            <p>Then we simply apply our polite ending 요 giving us 갔어요 and 먹었어요 for our fully-conjugated past-tense, polite form.
                You’re doing great, I know this isn’t easy the first time seeing it. Let’s see how our other verbs turn
                out in the past tense form.</p>

            <p>Pop quiz—what did you learn from this chart? A big takeaway is that <b>the past tense form of a verb is
                always one block longer than present tense.</b> Furthermore you’ll see from looking that it’s simple just to
                remember to add ㅆ+어 on top of the first layer of glue to make a verb past tense.</p>
