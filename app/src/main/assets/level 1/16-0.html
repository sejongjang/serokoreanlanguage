                    enjoy a lovely traditional meal. Or at least we can feast our eyes if not our stomachs. Now get
                    something to clean your drool and settle in (on the floor, as is the Korean tradition).</i></p>

            <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any people consider Asian food as a single subcategory in the food universe. (We’ll refrain from calling
                these people racist haha.) While East Asian ethnic groups have some similar and some distinctive
                features, and may have some cultural and linguistic crossover, food is one thing that really sets them
                apart. Korean food should certainly be its own category in the food universe, because there are so many
                subcategories of Korean food.</p>

            <p>How many? Well when we sat down to consider what food to share with you in this chapter we were
                completely overwhelmed by the number and variety of foods and food categories that exist and are unique
                to Korea. There’s so many that we could never share them all with you, so one thing you can be sure of
                when you visit Korea is that you’ll never stop discovering new foods to try! And honestly there’s a lot
                of good things about Korea, but seriously the food is amazing.</p>

            <p>Koreans call Korean food “한식" (韓食). You might not be very good at reading Chinese characters (yet), but
                here we have the character 한(韓) meaning “Korean”, and the character 식(食) meaning “food” or “meal”.
                Together they give us the meaning of “Korean food”. 한식 is similar to Western food in the same way that
                Usher’s latest EP is similar to Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony—i.e. they have nothing in common whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>There are many factors that contribute to differences in diet and culinary development. In Korea’s case,
                geography certainly played a big role. Their summers are hot and wet, while their winters are cold and
                snowy. This means that during warmer seasons, food has to be prepared and preserved to get through the
                winter. While that may not be so true anymore, that is how Koreans survived in ancient times. As such,
                pickling, drying, and fermenting are all expertly practiced in Korea.</p>
