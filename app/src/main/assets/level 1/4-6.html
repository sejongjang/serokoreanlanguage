                <p>Finally we'd be remiss if we didn't mention Korean television dramas and movies. Korean dramas
                    (K-drama) have long been the second leg of Hallyu. Korean dramas have gained huge popularity
                    overseas alongside k-pop. Some of the most popular K-dramas of all time include: Boys Over Flowers,
                    My Love from the Star, Descendants of the Sun, and the 'Reply' series. If you've never watched a
                    Korean drama they are super fun and a great way to learn Korean (probably better than k-pop if we're
                    being honest).
                </p>
                <p>While K-drama has many of the same charms as K-pop (handsome and pretty faces, and a sort of
                    wholesome harmlessness), it also has its own unique aspects. The best way to describe Korean dramas
                    as is "hearty". The actors and actresses really give it their all and the stories usually contain
                    uplifting messages. Check out some romantic highlight clips.</p>

                <p>If romance isn't really your thing then don't worry because there are tons of intense K-dramas like
                    the time-jumping, serial killer hunting series 'Signal', the high stress office drama 'Misaeng', or
                    'Save Me' about a religious cult that will stop at nothing.</p>
                <p>Along with Korean dramas, Korea has also produced many movies. Traditionally Korean movies have
                    struggled to gain recognition abroad but that is all changed now thanks to a recently released
                    masterpiece 'Parasite'. Directed by Bong Junho, Parasite is a true cinematic wonder and was
                    deservingly rewarded richly during awards season. Most notably Parasite is the first foreign
                    language film ever to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards (Oscars). If you've never seen it check
                    out the trailer below.</p>

                <p>So the truth is that there’s much moreFragment to the Korean Wave than just some manufactured Barbies and
                    Kens. It’s a push to return to the values that make us human. It’s a movement that, despite a
                    purpose of providing entertainment and earning profit, is also very uplifting.</p>
                <p>We hope you’ve enjoyed this little look into one of the most visible modern facets of Korea. We’ll be
                    going back and forth between talking about ancient and modern Korea, and naturally we’ll also be
                    talking about North Korea in the coming culture chapters. For now though, back to the language! (No
                    quiz this chapter).</p>
