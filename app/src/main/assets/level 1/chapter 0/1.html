            <p>Learning Korean is a real adventure and provides an absolutely intriguing and mind-expanding take on
                communication. Korean fascinating because Korean and English grammar are about as different as kimchi
                and cupcakes. To paraphrase a friend of mine who used to teach Korean, <i>“Korean is upside down, inside
                out, and backwards from English.” But hey, no pain no gain, right?</i></p>
            <p>Your brain is an incredible tool, and I am confident that with persistence, what may initially seem
                baffling is actually going to become very easy. You may even catch yourself saying things like, <i>“Dang,
                why is English so hard? It’s much better to do this the Korean way!”</i></p>
            <p>What’s more is that we’re going to do this the easy way. I’ll explain everything clearly and give a ton
                of examples as we go along. You’ll have native pronunciation for every example sentence provided, and
                you can break down every sentence to see all the parts in it. We’ll start from the bottom and work our
                way up, alternating frequently between reviewing and learning new content. That way you can keep
                learning quickly while solidifying what you have already learned. We’ll continually identify patterns
                and draw comparisons, thus, unraveling the seemingly complex code of Korean communication into
                manageable bite-size chunks.</p>
