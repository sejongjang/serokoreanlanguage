            <p>Korean, like English, has a lot of subtle sounds that your ear will have to grow accustomed to. These
                sounds are arranged in a way that can seem almost alien to westerners. Developing an ability to listen
                to Korean will be one of the main hurdles we deal with in Sero Korean Level 1. Fortunately, since you
                speak English you already use most of the sounds found in Korean during regular everyday speech.</p>
            <p>Another thing to consider is that Korean is a lot more consistent than English is when it comes to
                representing the sounds of the language in writing. Itâ€™s going to be easier to learn to read Korean
                using Korean letters, than it is trying to learn Korean using English letters.</p>
