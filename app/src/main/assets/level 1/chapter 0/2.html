            <p>Rather than dividing the program into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, Sero Language is
                divided into numbered levels. This approach gives us the flexibility to continue to add valuable
                content at a reasonable pace. Each level countains 30 chapters, and the chapters are not long. In fact,
                each chapter is designed to be completed within twenty to thirty minutes. This enables anyone to find
                time to do at least one chapter per day and complete an entire level in just one month</p>
            <p>Level one totals in at over 50,000 words, with 300+ examples sentences (including native-speaker
                recordings), 500+ vocabulary words, and much more. You should never feel
                like you’re drowning, since we’ve worked hard to strike the right balance between pushing forward
                quickly and taking enough time to understand a concept thoroughly.</p>
            <p>Difficult sections also feature popouts which remind you of concepts covered earlier or provide more
                in-depth explanations. If you have some experience with Korean or you are fast at grasping new
                concepts, feel free to skip over these pop-outs as <b>they contain no new information.</b> If you feel like
                you aren’t keeping up, go ahead and open the pop-outs by tapping on the words in green boxes like this.</p>
