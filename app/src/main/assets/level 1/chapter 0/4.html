        <p>One note before we get started—a common approach some people use when learning a foreign language is trying to put the new things they learn into the old mold of their native language. This approach works decently well for languages with a similar structure and/or a common root, but it can also cause a lot of problems since even closely related languages often have many subtle differences. The good news with Korean is that if you are a native English speaker the grammar is going to be unlike anything you’ve ever

            seen. This will help you avoid the problems inherent in the plug-and-go approach to language learning. You get to start with a clean slate. Example</p>
