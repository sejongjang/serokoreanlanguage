            <p>One note before we get started—a common approach some people use when learning a foreign language is
                trying to put the new things they learn into the old mold of their native language. This approach works
                decently well for languages with a similar structure and/or a common root, but it can also cause a lot
                of problems since even closely related languages often hav manye subtle differences. The good news with
                Korean is that if you are a native English speaker the grammar is going to be unlike anything you’ve
                ever seen. This will help you avoid the problems inherent in the plug-and-go approach to language
                learning.
                You get to start with a clean slate. *Example*</p>
            <p>If you didn’t really care for your grade school English grammar classes don’t worry. We won't get into
                anything too heady here. Rather this program is meant to give you a sense
                that someone is right by your side teaching you in a personal and understandable way. We’ll even keep things
                light-hearted with experiences from Korea, jokes, and fun example sentences. You’ve got nothing to
                sweat! Ready to get started? <i>Let’s go!</i></p>
