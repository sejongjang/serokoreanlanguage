            <p>If you didn’t really care for your grade school English grammar classes don’t worry. Until I began
                studying languages I didn’t really care about grammar either. This program is meant to give you a sense
                that someone is right by your side teaching you in a personal and natural way. I’ll even keep things
                light-hearted with experiences from Korea, jokes, and fun example sentences. You’ve got nothing to
                sweat! Ready to get started? Let’s go</p>
