            <p><i>Have you ever felt like foreign language books, tools, or apps are too limited, too incoherent, or
                    too disjointed to be helpful?
                    Have you ever wished there was something that would start at the beginning and teach you concepts
                    in a natural way,
                    continue to remind you of what you have learned, and build your skills one manageable step at a
                    time?
                    Have you wished for a way to learn languages that keeps things fun, interesting, and varied?
                    If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, then you’ve come to the right place.</i></p>

            <p>Welcome to Sero Korean. We’ve designed this program to provide a smooth and comprehensive introduction
                to Korean, including reading, writing, listening, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Sound like a
                lot to swallow? Well languages have a lot going on under the hood and only something truly
                comprehensive can help you become fully functional in a new language. While some websites or programs
                make grand promises and assure you that little study time is required, we know that consistently
                studying a broad-ranging curriculum in your target language is the real key to success. And we just so
                happen to have created such a curriculum.</p>
            <p>We’ve also included vital information about Korean culture and history. This information is included in
                separate cultural chapters that will keep things fresh and interesting while still teaching vocabulary.
                Integrating this all into one course allows us to provide you with a truly powerful and fun language
                learning tool! </p>
            <p>When you first start learning any new language it can feel like you’re drinking from a fire hose and
                that what you are learning isn’t sticking. With Sero Korean, we promise that we’ve done our best to
                bring down the water pressure and help you drink it all in. If you’re thirsty to learn then let’s get
                started!</p>
