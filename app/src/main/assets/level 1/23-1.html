            In Korean there is no equivalent to the English preposition word “of” and so 의 is also used for
            categorization. It works exactly like you’d imagine.. 대한민국의 국기 = The flag of South Korea.


            </p>
            <p>Since 의 is used essentially to connect two nouns together it is not combined with any other particles. 의
                is also used for fractions. For example, "1/3" would be "삼분의 일" or "one of 3 parts". "3/4" would then,
                following the same pattern, be "사분의 삼" or "3 of </p>

            <p><i>To pronounce it you just say 으 and then 이 in rapid succession. The thing that can really trip you up
                    here is that you’ll hear Koreans pronouncing this same combination differently! This is another
                    situation where it’s actually more comfortable to say something like “에" than it is to say 의. If we
                    do our trick of saying this five times fast <b>it just turns into a sort of “에” sound, which is what
                        you’ll hear most of the younger generation saying most of the time.</b>
                </i></p>
            <p><i>The problem is that you don’t always pronounce it as 에. When 의 appears combined with other letters, or
                    inside of words it’s more often pronounced with it’s original 으-이, sound. You can hear this in
                    examples like 거의 (Almost), 의견 (Opinion), and 띄다 (To stand out).
