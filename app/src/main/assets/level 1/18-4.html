                <p>왜: Why</p>
                <p>Why is it like that? or Why are you being like this? "왜 그래요?"</p>
                <p>Why don't you drink? "왜 안마셔요?"</p>
                <p>Do you know why it's like that? "왜 그런지 알아요? (왠지) 알아요?"</p><br>


                <p>누구/누가: Who</p>
                <p>Who are you/they? "누구예요?"
                </p>
                <p>Who will do it? "누가 할거예요?"</p>
                <p>The difference between 누구 and 누가 can be summed up like this. 누구 is usually used as a noun but rarely
                    the subject, hence you will almost never see 누구는 but 누가 is a contraction of 누구가 and is used as a
                    subject. For example, when we say, "Who is going?" we can use 누구 to say, "갈 사람은 누구예요?" but NOT "갈
                    사람은 누가예요". If we want to use 누가 then we can say, "누가 갈거예요?" but not, "누구 갈거예요?".</p>
                <p>*누군가: someone</p>
                <p>Someone will come "누군가 올거예요"</p><br>

                <p>무엇(뭐): What</p>

                <p>What do you want? "무엇을(뭐) 원해요?"</p>
                <p>What is it? "뭐예요?"</p>
                <p>What are you doing? "뭐해요?"</p>
                <p>무엇 is pretty formal and will rarely be heard in average conversation with someone you have met before
                    so Koreans much more prefer using 뭐 because it is so short and we all know how great contractions
                    are.</p>
                <p>*뭔가: Something</p>
                <p>I need something "뭔가 필요해요"</p>
                <p>Somehting isn't right "뭔가 아닌거같아요"</p>
                <br>
                <p>What are you getting at? "무슨(뭔) 소리예요?": Used when you understood but are digging for a reason why
                    they said it, how it relates, or what they mean.</p>
                <br>

                <p>몇: How many</p>
                <p>How many are there? "몇개 있어요?"</p>
                <p>What time is it? "몇시예요?"</p>
                <p>How many people are there? "거기 몇명이에요?" Or "거기 몇 명 있어요?"</p>
                <p>What year where you born? "몇년생이에요?" (Asked often to determine how old you are and seniority)
                </p>
                <p>How many months did you live in Korea? "한국에 몇개월 살았어요?"</p>
                <p>If you are asking the quantity of something then 몇 is your go to.</p>
