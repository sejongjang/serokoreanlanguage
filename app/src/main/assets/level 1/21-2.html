            <p>Other examples of prepositional sentences include:</p>
            <div class="center_context">
                <p>
                    산 위에 있어요<br>
                    책상 밑에 있어요<br>
                    병원 옆에 있어요<br>
                    아파트 단지 밖에 있어요<br>
                    마음 속에 있어요<br>
                    내 눈 앞에 있어요
                </p>
            </div>


            <p>Now time to explain why there are multiple propositions to describe the same thing like 가운데 and 중, 밑 and
                아래, 오른 and 우, 왼 and 좌, 안 and 속, and finally 밖 and 외. In the cases of 중, 우, 좌, and 외, these are the
                chinese counterparts to the pure korean words represented by the hanja (한자: 漢字) 중-中,우-右,좌-左, and 외-外
                respectively. You will rarely see 좌/우 except in old korean words and Google Maps directions. However, 중
                and 외 are used quite often in everyday conversation as in the examples, “사람들 중에 한 명은 착했어요" or “One
                person out of several was kind” and “날씨 외에는 오늘 좋았어요" or “Outside of the weather, today was good”

            </p>
            <p>The exceptions to the 4 step plan above are 오른, 왼, and 가운데. These 3 prepositions cannot just have an 에
                added to them but rather are used as such. 오른 and 왼 are followed by 쪽 meaning direction or 편 meaning
                side which are then followed by 에. This is demonstrated by the sentence “의자 오른편에 있어요" or “It is on the
                right side of the chair”. When using them for direction you would use 쪽 followed by (으)로 to make a
                sentence like “왼쪽으로 가세요" or “go to the left”. 가운데 is special in that 에 or 로 is not necessary to make a
                natural sentence so just saying “가운데 타요" or “Ride in the middle” is fine.

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, 전 and 후, outside of their use in specific words like 전문 front door and 후문 back door, follow after
                verbs and are used to describe when something happened or will happen. 전 differs from 후 in that 전 if
                preceded by a gerund. A gerund is a verb that is made into a noun. Gerunds will be covered in level 2
                but here is a brief explanation. In english we may say, “I love eating apples”. Here we changed the verb
                eat into a noun by conjugating it to ‘eating’ and love becomes our new verb in this sentence. One way to
                change verbs into nouns is to replace the 다 in their unconjugated from with a 기.
            </p>
            <p>For example, 먹다 meaning ‘to eat’ would be changed to 먹기 and 가다 meaning ‘to go’ would be changed to 가기. So
                since 전 means before, if you say “먹기 전에" that would mean, “before you eat”. 전's antonym is 후, and 후
                means after. However, 후 is not preceded by a gerund as 전 is, but rather 은/ㄴ added to the verb instead.
                For example, for the verb 하다 meaning ‘to do’, you would get rid of the 다 and add a ㄴ (if 하다 had a 받침
                consonant like in 먹다, it would be 은). “After you do that” would then be represented in Korean as “그것을 한
                후에" and “after you eat that” would be “그것을 먹은 후에". Don’t worry too much about the concepts of ㄴ/은 and
                gerunds right now as we will be going over them extensively in later chapters because of their extreme
                importance to Korean sentence structure.
