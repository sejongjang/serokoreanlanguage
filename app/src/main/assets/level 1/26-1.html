            <p>가을 Fall: Fall is the other time of the year when weather is just fantastic. With even warmer temperatures
                than spring and the slight breeze reminiscent of the beginning of the harvest season makes indoor and
                outdoor activities perfect for fall. If you haven’t noticed by now, Koreans’ main way to party is to
                hold a ton of festivals. Korea is full of deciduous trees, so the mix of red, orange, yellow, and green
                colors that cover the peninsula are stunning. This is why things like the Paju and/or Baekyang Maple
                Leaf Festivals, Jinju Lantern Festival, and the Seoul World Firework Festival attract so many people
                every year. Hiking through the gorgeous fall colored forests also is an extremely popular activity, so
                get your hiking gear and enjoy that fall breeze on your way up the mountain. Many times you can stop by
                a buddhist temple on your way up. The beauty in their architecture and the sacredness of the grounds
                make these places great for meditation and well worth the trip.

            <p>겨울 Winter: Winter is a magical time in Korea where the already beautiful landscapes and skylines are
                dusted by the mystical white power we call snow or 눈 in Korean (and yes, the word for ‘eye’ and ‘snow’
                are both 눈). There are a surprising amount of outdoor activities that highlight the beauties of winter
                that you can experience while in Korea. A few of which include the TaeBaek Snow Festival (태백 눈축제) which
                showcases immaculate snow and ice sculptures that will blow you away. They even have an entire cafe,
                from the walls, to the chairs and tables, made out of snow and ice where you can warm up with a cup of
                hot chocolate or coffee. The 2018 Winter Olympics were hosted in PyeongChang (평창) located in the depths
                of Gangwon Province. If you’re looking for moreFragment of a thrilling time, then you can experience world class
                ski resorts, restaurants, and hot springs if you want to take a trip out to the former olympics venue.
                Also, Places like Gunsan (군산) and Yeosu (여수) are a bit far from Seoul but are dream winter vacation
                destinations that have beautiful scenery and views of the ocean, while also offering some of the best
                food of the entire peninsula.
            </p>
            <p>No matter what time of the year you are in Korea, there are thousands of festivals, shows, hikes,
                restaurants, and other activities to enjoy. So with with Korea’s 4 seasons in mind, let’s look at what
                we need to know to describe it’s weather patterns and other weather related items.
