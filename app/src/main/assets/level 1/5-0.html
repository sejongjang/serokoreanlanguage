                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>Alright, are you ready for your first chapter on
                        Korean grammar? Don’t sweat, this won’t be too
                        tricky. We’re going to be talking about the copula. “Wait... The co-pu-la-what-ah?”</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="mstandardpara">
                <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he copula is the most important verb in
                    any language. It’s the verb “to be”. This is the verb that
                    allows you to say A = B. A few examples will no doubt suffice. In English the verb to be is “is”,
                    “am”, or “are”. For example: “This is a white chair.”, “I am exhausted.”, and “You are a fool.”
                    (just kidding I know you’re super smart). In all of these cases A = B, or in other words the thing
                    presented before the verb is characterized by the thing after the verb. In English the copula is
                    also known as a “Linking Verb” because it links two things together.</p>
                <p>In Korean the copula is especially important because Korean is a verb-centric language. <b>Other
                        parts
                        of
                        the sentence can often be omitted, but you must always have a verb in proper Korean
                        sentences.</b>
                    Now is
                    also a good time to make an important distinction between English and Korean grammar. In English we
                    follow a strict Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentence structure. In the sentence, " I eat apples", "I"
                    is the subject, "eat" is the verb, and "apples" are the object being acted upon by the subject.</p>
                <p>Now get ready to have your mind blown, because Korean follows a different pattern. <b>In Korean the
                        word
                        order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).</b> Following this pattern, our previously stated sentence would
                        now be organized as, "I apples eat". A little strange right?  I mentioned earlier that Korean
                    sentences always need a
                    verb.
                    According to this new information that crucially important <b>verb must always come at the end of
                        the
                        sentence.</b> You don't get too many always statements in language, but always having a verb and
                    always
                    putting it at the end are two rules you can always stick to.
                </p>
                <p>If we impose this Korean order onto our math equation it's a little bit awkward… Okay really awkward.
                    We have A, B, = . While it may seem counterintuitive, that's exactly how Korean works. This SOV
                    order
                    is consistent whether it's a linking verb or any other. In fact, Korean is much more consistent in
                    this
                    regard than English is. In English you change the word order when you ask questions (“Is that your
                    house”). So, in English the verb sometimes comes first. Thankfully Korean has none of this confusing
                    silliness and <b>when you ask questions you just raise the pitch in your voice at the end of the
                        sentence.</b></p>
