            <p>By now you’re getting used to hearing that Korean works in a different way than English does. This case
                is no exception (to the exceptions… hehe). Unlike English, <b>Korean sentences have more flexible word
                    order</b>. In fact, you can almost say that as long as the verb comes at the end you can speak in
                any order. Granted there are some normal speaking conventions related to word order. <i>How can this be
                    possible? Wouldn’t such flexibility just result in sentences becoming garbled jumbles of nonsense
                    that’s impossible for anyone to understand?</i></p>
            <p>Well… no actually. Korean has developed to be as well-structured and understandable as any other
                language. You see, Korean is part of a different class of languages known as “agglutinative” languages.
                This is a fancy way of saying that words don’t change forms to fit into the sentence, but rather things
                get stuck onto the words that tell us what their role in the sentence is. That’s why Korean has no need
                for things like subject-verb agreement.</p>
            <p>So, what do we stick onto words to define their role in the sentence? We stick on particles—a type of
                grammar marker that doesn’t exist in English. <b>In Korean, particles define things like subject,
                    topic, object, indirect object, possession, direction, means, inclusion, exclusion etc.</b></p>
            <p>Whoa. That’s some powerful stuff. In fact, particles are so important that even if we knew every word in
                the whole Korean dictionary, we could never organize those words into anything intelligible without
                particles. In the coming chapters we’ll be discussing more of the most important and well used
                particles in the Korean language.</p>
            <p>We've already talked about the verb 이다 which behaves like a sort of psuedo-particle and sticks onto the
                end of nouns. Now we are going to introduce our first real particles.</p>
