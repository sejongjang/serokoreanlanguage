            <p>Moving right along we've got 이, another vowel with no y-vowel version.</p>

            <p>이 represents the wide “ee” sound you make in words like “eat”, “cheesy,” and “lady”. Something
                unique about this one however is that it is the only non-”Y” vowel that when combined with ㅅ produces
                an “sh” sound. In fact it’s actually impossible to reproduce the English word “see”, in Korean. 시 is
                always pronounced like “she”.</p>
            <p>이 is also present in a lot of compound vowels including 외, 위, and 의.</p>

            <p>These will take some explaining. At first glance you may think that 외 should be pronounced as "oi" but
                as you've just heard that's not the case. 외 is in fact pronounced like "weh". The "oi" sound in Korean
                is made by separating 오 and 이 (The word 오이 in fact means "cucumber", ha!). If you say 외 ten times fast
                you'll find that the sound does drift to become something like "weh", which is probably why this
                compound vowel has come to be pronounced this way.</p>
            <p>Out of the three of these 위 is the easiest. It's pronounced as "we", which also makes sense
                based on it's spelling, 우-이.</p>
            <p>As for 의... this one is a bit of a doozey. 의 is unique because there are essentially three different
                ways to
                pronounce it. We'll demonstrate these three pronunciations as the first three items below. Just know
                that the pronuncation depends on the position that 의 occupies in the word.</p>

            <p>About 의, in the first case above (의경) you'll notice that it is pronounced like it looks as "으-이". When 의
                comes at the beginning of a word you enunciated both sounds in quick succession. In the next example,
                정의, you can hear a tiny bit of "으" but mostly you just get an "이" sound when 의 comes at the end of a
                word. <i>Then what the heck's going on with 나의?</i> In this case it's actually two words. 의 is a
                possesive particle that attaches to the end of words, and when it's used like this 의 is basically
                pronounced as an "eh" sound. This is the most common use of 의 so you'll get used to hearing it that way
                a lot.</p>
