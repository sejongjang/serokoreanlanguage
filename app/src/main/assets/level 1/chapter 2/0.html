            <p><i>Great job on the last chapter and welcome to the wonderful world of Korean vowels. Once we start
                    putting these vowels together with the
                    consonants we learned last chapter you’re really going to be able to read and say a lot. Buckle up
                    and let’s get going.</i></p>

                    <h1><audio id="audio10" src="../../audio/ya.mp3" autostart="false"></audio><a onclick="PlaySound10()">야</a></h1>
                    <script>
                        function PlaySound10() {
                            var sound10 = document.getElementById("audio10");
                            sound10.play()

            <p>Our first new vowel is 야 (<i>We’ll be combining our vowels with ㅇ when we just want to hear the vowel
                    sound, as is customary in Korea</i>). You’ll immediately notice its similarity to the vowel 아 that
                we
                used all last chapter. This similarity is completely intentional and logical. In Korean taking a
                regular vowel and adding another line onto it adds a “Y” sound to the beginning of the vowel. So in
                this case taking the vowel 아 and adding a line made it into a “yah” as in “yacht” sound. You’ll find
                this to be a
                consistent rule of Hangul.</p>
            <p>What happens if we put some of our consonants, like ㄱ or ㄴ, together with ㅑ?</p>

                            var sound9 = document.getElementById("audio9");

            <p>These sorts of combinations sound positively foreign to English speakers but are completely normal in
                Korean. You’ll often see consonants followed immediately by a “Y’ sound. Granted there are a few cases
                in
                English where something similar occurs. When you say the word “new” you’re actually saying something
                close to “nyu”. </p>
            <p>Based on what I just told you, you’re no doubt wondering “What about 갹, 갼, 냑, and 냔?” Although these are
                technically valid combinations, they are not commonly used blocks. In fact, out of the over 3,000
                possible block combinations in Korean, a mere 500 combinations constitute 99% the language. The other
                couple thousand are used only in extremely rare and/or ancient Korean. There are also some combinations
                that have simply never been used. This no doubt has something to do with Hangul being created long
                after the spoken-language was already well established. King Sejong actually made a system that was
                more powerful and flexible than the language itself needed. Pretty impressive.</p>
            <p>This practice below should be a no-brainer:</p>

            <p>We should note that there are some consonant combinations that never combine with 야. For example, you
                will never see ㄴ/ㄹ and ㄹ/ㄹ carry-over sound combined with 야 (like 달랴 or 난랴—seriously these are weird).</p>
            <p>Also, recall that we taught you ㅅ makes an "s" or "sh" sound. As you saw above, ㅅ combined with 야 gives
                us a "sha" sound. This rules is true across the board. <b>ㅅ will make an "sh" sound when combined with
                any y-vowel.</b> In the next pages we'll be combining the
                double-line y-vowels like 야 with their regular counterparts, since just adding a "Y" sound is a piece of cake.</p>
