            <p>Excellent work with the vowels, thankfully they are fewer than the Korean consonants!</p>
            <p>Notably missing from the list of vowels in Korean is two sounds that are commonly used in English—“I” as
                in “igloo” or “ignorant”, along with “A” and in “attitude” or “apple”. These sounds are entirely
                nonexistant in Korean
                <b>so do not use them</b>. We have to be careful to cut out the sounds that are foreign to Korean, even
                though
                there’s going to be a tendency for you to mix these in there with other vowels.</p>
            <p>Go ahead and review below and you can take the vowel quiz!</p>
            <ul><b>
                    <li>Adding a line onto vowels that have one protruding line adds a "Y" sound in front of the vowel
                        (아-야, 어-여, 오-요, 우-유, 애-얘, and 에-예).</li>
                    <li>으 and 이 don't have y-vowel versions.</li>
                    <li>The compound vowels in 한글(Hangul) are 와, 워, 외, 위, 의, 왜, and 웨.</li>
                    <li>외, 왜, and 웨 all sound the same.</li>
                    <li>에 and 애 sound very similar, and so does 의 when it is acting as a possesive marker.</li>
                    <li>At the beginning (or middle) of a word 의 is pronounced as "으-이", and at the end of a word it just makes an "이" sound.</li>
                    <li>Badchim spelled out in Korean is 받침, and Hangul is 한글.</li>
                </b></ul>
