            <p>This is the first word that everyone asks about when they find out you speak Korean. “How do you say
                hello in Korean!?” Literally translated this word is actually a question meaning something like “Are
                you at peace?”—hence the question mark. It’s become such a common expression of greeting, however, that
                it’s often not spoken with a questioning tone of voice. It’s like how you ask “How are you?” in English
                without expecting any particular answer. It’s just the thing to say. Koreans are likely
                to respond to a greeting of “안녕하세요?” by asking you the same, “네 안녕하세요?”—“Yes (I am at peace), and
                you?”.</p>

            <div id="myAuthornote" class="authornote" onclick="closeNav()">
                <p><b><i>매튜 선생</i></b><br>As an amusing side note I was once strolling the back streets of Korea on a
                    bright
                    sunny
                    morning and I greeted a stranger with a friendly “안녕하세요?". To my chagrin he didn’t respond in the
                    usual cheery way that Koreans do. Instead he said with his head down, “안녕하지 못해요”—“I can’t be at
                    peace”. I was so taken aback that I was at a complete loss for words as the man walked dejectedly
                    on by. His completely deflated answer was sad, but I laugh every time I think of it because it was
                    so unexpected and in such stark contrast to my bubbly mood and the sun-shiny weather.</p>

            <span onclick="openNav()">
                <div class="authorcard">
                    <div class="authorarrow"><img src="../../img/leftarrow.png" alt="left"></div>
                </div>
            </span>

            <p style="margin-right: 15px">Anyway, take careful note of the pronunciation here. As common expressions
                often are, this word is
                spoken in a very slurred manner. “안녕하세요” actually comes off as something closer to “안냐세여". Honestly
                just one word can be enough for Koreans to tell you are good at Korean, and if you nail the
                pronunciation of this one you are likely to be showered with praise.</p>
