                <div class="center_context">
                    <p>사라는 예쁜 여자예요.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lit. “(as for) Sarah pretty girl is.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>In the first sentence here, we can see that 사라 is the topic, and in this case 예쁘다 has been conjugated
                    to
                    a noun-modifier form. Think back to chapter 13 recall that we learned the future tense
                    modifier ㄹ/을. You can attach this modifier to verbs (and yes, adjectives too) to say that something
                    will
                    do or be a certain way.

                </p>
                <div class="center_context">
                    <p>밥 먹을거예요.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>In this case the verb 먹다 has been conjugated to future tense form by adding 을.

                </p>
                <p>There are descriptive adjectives such as tall, skinny, ugly, weak, etc. that are formed by adding a
                    ㄴ/은 to an adjective followed by the noun being described. Let's look at some examples.
                </p>
                <div class="center_context">
                    크다 --> 크 --> 큰 --> 큰 차: "Big car"<br>
                    작다 --> 작 --> 작은 --> 작은 집: "Small house"<br>
                    잘 생기다 --> 잘 생기 --> 잘 생긴 --> 잘 생긴 오빠: "Handsome Oppa"<br>
                    *멀다 --> 멀 --> 먼 --> 먼 곳: "Far way place"
                </div>
                <p>*Instead of conjugating adjectives like 멀다 into 멀은 usually the ㄹ is just replaced by a ㄴ for
                    simplicity in pronunciation. For example, 만들다 --> 만든 and 달다 --> 단.</p>
