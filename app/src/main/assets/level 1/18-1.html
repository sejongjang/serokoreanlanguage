                <p>As for the other words, they mostly function about as you'd expect. First the “어” words.
                </p>
                <p>어디: Where</p>
                <p>Where is Gangnam Station? "강남역 어디예요?</p>
                <p>Where is my phone? "저의 핸드폰 어디 있어요?</p>
                <p>Where is the teacher? "선생님 어디예요?</p>
                <p>Where are you going? "어디 가요?"</p>
                <p>As you can see there is a difference of usage between 있어요 and our copula 이다. When refering to
                    inanimate objects such as phones, food, etc. then we use 있다. This roughly gives us the translation
                    of "where does ___ exist?". However, when refering to people or locations then we use 이다. This gives
                    us the feeling of "Where is _____?".</p>

                <p>언제: When</p>
                <p>When is the festival? "축제 언제예요?</p>
                <p>When are you going to the party? "파티에 언제 가요?"</p>
                <p>When does the store close? "가게 언제 닫아요?"</p>
                <p>"When" is a bit moreFragment straight forward but one thing to remember is that it is moreFragment natural for koreans
                    to put the noun at the start of the sentence and then put "언제" in the middle next to the verb, as you can see in the examples above.</p>
