                <p style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;"><i>We haven’t been able to talk much about
                        conjunctions in Korean yet, aside from learning a bit about
                        “고”. This chapter we’ll be diving into the most common ways of saying “because” in Korean. This
                        will
                        allow us to begin to give reasons for things and making longer, moreFragment-complete ideas.

                <p style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n Korean there are multiple ways to express the reason for things. English is similar—there’s
                    actually
                    quite a few words we can use besides, “because”. Think of words like “since”, “therefore”, “so”,
                    “due
                    to”, “by reason of”, “for”, etc. etc. We can actually make a very long list of words that can be
                    used to
                    express reasons for things, and they all have slightly different nuances. Unfortunately, it’s
                    possible
                    to make a similarly long list in Korean.

                </p>
                <p>The good news is that there are a couple of forms you can use that pass in most situations, so we’ll
                    be
                    learning the most common forms of “because’ here in this chapter and then be picking up some moreFragment in
                    the
                    future.

                    <p><i>So far we’ve been using some Korean names as characters for our little mock dialogue sections,
                            but
                            you
                            may have been wondering about the naming conventions behind these characters’ names. We’ll
                            reveal
                            the
                            mystery in this chapter and also help you figure out what to call your Korean friends (hint:
                            you
                            usually don’t call them by their name).

                    <p>In few areas are the differences between the western world and Korea as prominent as they are
                        when it
                        comes to addressing others. The naming and title conventions of the Far East always take some
                        getting
                        used to for westerners. One thing people find especially disconcerting when learning Korean is
                        the
                        lack
                        of one easy word to address someone (in English others can comfortably be called ‘you’). There’s
                        a
                        great
                        TED video explaining the concept of ‘you’ in other languages, if you’re interested in checking
                        in
                        out:
                        TED-Ed: One of the most difficult words to translate... Don’t fret however, here again,
                        different
                        doesn’t mean bad. We’ll start with the enjoyable names section.

                    </p>
                    <p>Korean names are fun! They developed in a different way than English names, but let's start with
                        the
                        similarities. In Korea people do have family names that are passed down from generation to
                        generation
                        like in English-speaking countries. The name is also passed down through the paternal line, like
                        English-countries... and that’s about the extent of the similarities. Oh and there are boy
                        names,
                        girl
                        names, and names that work for both genders just like English (it’ll take some time to be able
                        to
                        distinguish between these).
