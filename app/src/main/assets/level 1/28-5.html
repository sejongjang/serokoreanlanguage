            <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that Korean has honorific or humble forms of many words. Honorific words
                elevate others. One type of honorific word is created by adding 님. In Korean, adding the postfix 님 onto
                titles makes them honorific. We can take the word for “mom”, “엄마" and make it into the honorific “어머님”
                (“mother”). In English there’s a big difference between words like “Mister” and “Sir”. One can sound
                petulant and the other sounds subservient. These Korean words work a similar way. Typically if it’s your
                own possessions or family you don’t add the honorific and if it’s someone else’s then you do.

            </p>

            <p>
                The same thing applies for humble or honorific words. Speak humbly about yourself and speak horrifically
                about others (particularly those older than yourself).

            </p>
            <p>In Korean the way you speak changes not just depending on who you’re talking to, but also depending on
                who you’re talking about. In other words, Korean has a built in honorific for people you’re talking
                about that’s separate and distinct from these polite/formal endings we’ve been talking about which are
                targeted toward your direct audience.
            </p>
            <p>This works by adding (으)시 to the base form of a Korean verb. Let’s take the verb 앉다(to sit) for example.
                Since this one ends in a consonant(ㅈ) we’re going to need our spacer in there. So our new
                subject-honorific verb is 앉으시다. This means that while you can say “할머니가 의자에 앉아요.”(Grandma sits in the
                chair), it’s more appropriate to say “할머니가 의자에 앉으세요.”
            </p>
            <p>In this sentence the honorific 시 is conjugated to 요 form. We won’t go into the mechanics of how this
                works right now, but you get the idea. Adding a 시 honorific changes the conjugation of the verbs and
                since it always conjugates the same way it actually makes things easier. We’ll definitely go into this
                in more depth coming up in chapters 14 and 15 so sit tight!
