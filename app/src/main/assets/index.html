    <h2>welcome to Sero Korean</h2>
    Highlight the technical feats accomplished in the technology.
    Use example sentences and have everything (except for names) tagged in the sentence.
    If there is a tag present that isn’t registered as having been learned in the ULP
    (User Language-Skills Profile) then the example sentence won’t show up until the relevant tags have been learned.
    In many cases the software will automatically edit the sentence to be easier/match the learner’s level.
    Furthermore the ULP will highlight to what degree each piece of grammar/vocab has been learned.
    If a word has multiple uses it will keep track of which uses have been learned and which haven’t.
    We also want the user to be able to specify a usage scenario. For example you take the first profile test when you first launch the program,
    and results are associated with your account. (The tests should be free and also available online as a tool to get enthusiasts interested.
    The software should be trained over time to be able to accurately guess what vocabulary and grammar you know based,
    even if they don’t specifically show up on the test. There will be a middle state of “probably learned” in the ULP
    until these are confirmed later in actual usage of the program). Next, after you take the test you can look
    through a broad list of usage scenarios and study those. If you want to learn how to ask about and pay for food/convenience items
    you select that scenario. If you want to make a bank account you can select that scenario. Your ULP will give you a rating in every category
    (which would also be interesting for enthusiasts) and will even rate you overall in terms of reading, writing, listening, and speaking skill.
    (Speaking is going to be the most tricky. We will have to train the AI to recognize accent, intonation, aspiration, etc.
    Perhaps partner with Google and use their assistant API) Everything centers around the ULP.
