        <h3>Chapter 1 - Reading Korean—Consonants (한글의 자음)</h3>
        Some people have difficulty dealing with change or new things. If you’re one of those people then just believe me, this is a good change. Introducing the best writing system in the world—Hangul (lit. “Korean writing”). It’s arguably more consistent, more logical, and easier to learn than any other writing system in the world. In fact, the hardest part is just going to be pronouncing it right.

        So where did this amazing writing system come from and why have I never heard of it? The creation of Hangul is credited to the legendary King Sejong (세종대왕) who was born in AD 1397. Before the times of King Sejong, Koreans were completely reliant on borrowed Chinese characters. Chinese writing had been adapted, albeit messily, to work with Korean.

        I know what you’re wondering. Why, if they already had a writing system, did King Sejong up and decide to invent a new one? First of all, if you’ve ever tried to learn Chinese characters you’ll understand that it’s a non-trivial task (to put it lightly). Basically, you have to remember thousands of unique characters, many with more than ten strokes. Even natives spend years learning how to read and write fluently. This was also true in Korea,

        where only the upper class could afford the long and expensive education required to learn to read and write.

        Secondly, despite Western stereotypes about Asian languages, the fact is that Chinese and Korean are fundamentally different languages with different roots, sounds, sentence structure, etc. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it would be as difficult to figure out a way to write English in Chinese characters as it was to write Korean in Chinese characters. Nevertheless, given no viable alternative, the Koreans had since ancient times been using Chinese characters to write. What a headache!

        So along comes King Sejong, who decides to do something to address these problems. He wants to create a writing system that is easy enough to be accessible to the lower class (those with limited educational opportunity), and one that gives Korea a greater sense of national identity. While many people have invented new alphabets and languages throughout history, what made the difference in adoption here is that this time it was done by royalty, and it was done in an extremely logical and scientific way.

        Historically Korea has received relatively minimal attention internationally, however since the invention of Hangul it’s gained tremendous prestige and Korea is playing an ever more important role politically, economically, and especially culturally in the modern world. More and more people are learning about Korea and how’s it’s unique from its bigger and traditionally more influential neighbors, China and Japan.

        We hope you don’t mind these little historical tidbits. We firmly believe that history and culture are so closely intertwined with languages that you can’t really gain a good understanding of one without the others. We promise all this information will be useful later on. So now we can really get to the meat and potatoes of Hangul.

        By now you’ll have noticed that Hangul seems a lot boxier (sort of like Chinese) than most other alphabet-based languages. This is because Hangul is a kind of hybrid between

        character-based writing systems and alphabet-based writing systems. It takes the best of both worlds while also minimizing many of the difficulties inherent in both systems. We’ve already told you that Hangul is the Korean alphabet, but unlike most western alphabets the letters in Hangul are no good on their own. Hangul is made up of blocks of letters. Each block basically forms one character.

        What does that mean? Well in English, words are written by stringing letters together followed by spaces to separate words. Now imagine if instead of organizing letters this way, we put them into square blocks. Each block would be pronounced as one syllable, and spaces between words would be maintained. What would the result be like? Well...

        Now compare that with the same phrase in Korean.

        이렇게 보일 수도 있어요.

        You can see that English letters have to be awkwardly stretched and squashed for each syllable to fit into one imaginary square block. At first glance, a system like this may seem cumbersome but there are clear advantages. First of all, putting letters into blocks allows more letters fit into a smaller space. It does take a bit more vertical real estate than regular English writing, but it saves a ton of space horizontally. Secondly, you don’t have to guess how many syllables a word has, as each block represents exactly one syllable. That means pronunciation is simplified. Sound like a decent system? Yeah, King Sejong thought so too.

        Unlike English writing, King Sejong designed Korean from the ground up to fit into these character blocks. As a result, Korean letters were made to stretch and warp into shape, depending on their position in the block. Given that these letters are meant to change shape, their design lends itself to the task.

        Now let’s get started learning the actual letters and their pronunciation, but remember, at least one consonant and one vowel must be combined to make a valid block. Next chapter I’ll also be showing you how multiple consonants and multiple vowels all combine. For this chapter however, we’ll stick to one vowel sound while I teach you the consonants.
