        <h3>Chapter 4- 한류—What is the Korean Wave?</h3>
        Along with our adventures learning Korean grammar, pronunciation, spelling, and what-have-you, we’ll also be taking some breathers here and there to help you refresh your mind and give you time to absorb what you’ve learned so far. These culture chapters will also serve the secret purpose of making you better at Korean. “What? How can that be?” Well it turns out that knowing how to talk to Koreans doesn’t do you much good if you don’t know what to talk to them about. Like I said, language, culture, and history are inseparably intertwined. We’ll have you not just talking like, but also thinking like a Korean in no time.

        For our first little segment I’ve elected to talk about one of the main reasons this app exists and the reason many people become interested in learning Korean. That reason is 한류(韓流), known in English as “The Korean Wave”.

        What is the Korean Wave? Put simply, it’s a revolution in the entertainment industry that is taking the world by storm. Starting about ten years ago (with roots going back much further), Korean movies, music, and television began gaining serious international recognition. Since then the Korean Wave has only gotten bigger and gained more momentum.

        In a world dominated by Hollywood, many people have found Korean storytelling techniques to be refreshing. The stories are character driven and uplifting. Korean directors rely less on splashy special effects and more on impressively talented and good-looking actors and actresses, coupled with hearty writing. If you’ve never watched a Korean drama I highly recommend trying one out. I’ll just warn you that they can be extremely addictive!

        The Korean music industry has been no slouch either. For proof you need look no further than Youtube’s most-viewed videos chart—one of the most viewed videos on Youtube is the incredibly famous “Gangnam Style”. Psy’s masterpiece of humor held the

        view-number crown for years, and besides Gangnam style there’s at least 35 other Korean Pop (often abbreviated to K-pop) videos with more than 100 million views!

        Many people attribute this to the Korean penchant for “manufactured” stars. Big entertainment companies often recruit very young children through auditions and through scouts, and then they train them for years before their big debut. The companies pair the trainees with professional vocal, dance and even acting instructors. Those who perform well are promised a future of fame and fortune, while those who can’t keep up or handle the pressure of such a competitive system are let go and return to regular student life.

        The critics of such a system say that it’s too artificial and doesn’t allow for artists outside the mainstream to succeed. They also worry about the ethical issues of long-term contracts with onerous terms being signed by teenagers. Furthermore, they argue that company comes before art, stifling creativity.

        On the other hand, it’s hard to argue with the success of the star-factory that is the Korean entertainment industry. Advocates say that this system allows people to develop skills far beyond what they would have been able to without the professional help the companies give them. As in all other forms of business, competition drives the bar ever-higher, and the music, choreography, and film produced is definitely impressive. Celebrities are also held to a high bar of behavior and there is great pressure (and perhaps contractual obligations) pushing them to be good role models for the general public. This contrasts starkly with the behavior of other stars internationally who are basically self-managed.

        More recently there’s also been a push to broaden the international appeal of Korean entertainment, as evidenced by the recruitment of stars from other countries in Asia and Koreans raised in other countries throughout the world. Many Korean songs are produced not just in Korean, but also in Chinese, Japanese, and/or English. Korean stars learn many languages and frequently take international tours.

        There’s also an unusual phenomenon that’s almost unique to the Korean entertainment industry. The versatility of these stars allows them to do everything. It’s not

        unusual for a celebrity to be involved in a band, film, drama, lend their voice in creation of the soundtrack for the drama, appear in product-endorsement commercials, participate in comedy shows, and model for fashion shows and magazines all at the same time! While many western celebrities are typically limited to just acting, or just singing, you’ll be astonished to see your favorite star doing everything and appearing everywhere on TV and the internet in Korea. And the really crazy thing is that many of these stars succeed in doing it all. Let me give you a couple examples.
