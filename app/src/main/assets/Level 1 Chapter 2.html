        <h3>Chapter 2 -Reading Korean Part 2—Vowels (한글의 모음)</h3>
        Welcome to the wonderful world of Korean vowels. Once we start putting these vowels together with the consonants we learned last chapter you’re really going to be able to read and say a lot. Buckle up and let’s get going.

        야 Our first new vowel is 야 (Note we’ll be combining our vowels with ㅇ when we just want to hear the vowel sound, as is customary in Korea). You’ll immediately notice its similarity to the vowelㅏ that we already learned. This similarity is completely intentional and logical. In Korean taking a regular vowel and adding another line onto it adds a “Y” sound to the beginning of the vowel. So in this case we took the vowel 아 and adding a line made it into 야 (“yah” as in “yacht”). You’ll find this to be a consistent rule of Hangul.

        Now if we put some of our letters, like ㄱ or ㄴ together with 야 we get 갸(“gya”) and 냐 (“nya”). These sorts of combinations sound positively foreign to English speakers but are completely normal in Korean. You’ll often see consonants followed immediately by a “Y’ sound. Granted there are a few cases in English where something similar occurs. When you say the word “new” you’re actually saying something close to “nyu”.

        Based on what I just told you, you’re no doubt wondering “What about 갹, 갼, 냑, and 냔?” Although these are technically valid combinations, they are not commonly used

        blocks. In fact, out of the over 3,000 possible block combinations in Korean, a mere 500 combinations constitute 99% the language. The other couple thousand are used only in extremely rare and/or ancient Korean. There are also some combinations that have simply never been used. This no doubt has something to do with Hangul being created long after the spoken-language was already well established. King Sejong actually made a system that was more powerful and flexible than the language itself needed. Pretty impressive.
